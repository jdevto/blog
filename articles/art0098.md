If you've ever wanted separate email addresses for different purposes — without creating new accounts — Gmail makes it easy with **+aliases**.
This tip was first shared in the [official Gmail blog](https://gmail.googleblog.com/2008/03/2-hidden-ways-to-get-more-from-your.html) back in 2008 — and it still works today

## What Are Gmail +Aliases?

Gmail allows you to create unlimited variations of your email address by adding a `+alias` before `@gmail.com`.
All mail still goes to your main inbox.

---

## Step 1: Choose Your Base Gmail Address

Example:

```text
johndoe@gmail.com
```

---

## Step 2: Create Your First Alias

Just add `+logarchive` before `@gmail.com`:

```text
johndoe+logarchive@gmail.com
```

---

## Step 3: Create Another Alias

You can add as many as you like — for example:

```text
johndoe+audit@gmail.com
```

---

> ⚠️ **You do not need to set these up in Gmail.**
> They work automatically — Gmail will deliver mail for both to `johndoe@gmail.com`.

## Why This Matters

Using Gmail +aliases helps you:

* **Organize your inbox** — create filters that match `To: johndoe+logarchive@gmail.com` and automatically label or file them.
* **Track signups** — use a unique alias for each service to know where email leaks come from.
* **Simplify life** — no extra accounts to manage, no extra passwords to remember.
