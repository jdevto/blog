## 📘 Introduction

This guide shows how to configure and use AWS SSO (IAM Identity Center) from your CLI using the `aws configure sso` command. It includes step-by-step setup, login, validation, and cleanup.

---

## ✅ Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure:

* You have AWS IAM Identity Center (formerly AWS SSO) set up in your AWS Organization.
* You have permission to access an assigned AWS account and permission set.
* You’ve installed the [AWS CLI v2](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-cliv2.html).

> ❗ `aws configure sso` only works with AWS CLI v2 and above.

---

## ⚙️ Step 1: Configure AWS SSO

Run the following command:

```bash
aws configure sso
```

You'll be prompted for:

* **SSO Start URL**: The URL to your AWS SSO portal (e.g., `https://your-sso-portal.awsapps.com/start`)
* **SSO Region**: The region where SSO is configured (e.g., `ap-southeast-2`)

> 📝 You may see `SSO registration scopes [sso:account:access]` — this is expected and grants access to your assigned accounts.

A browser window will open showing:

**A prompt asking to allow `botocore-client-...` access to your data will appear — this is expected and part of the AWS SSO login process.**

Click **Allow access** to continue.

If you only have access to one account and role, the CLI will auto-select them:

```plaintext
The only AWS account available to you is: 123456789012
Using the account ID 123456789012
The only role available to you is: AdministratorAccess
Using the role name "AdministratorAccess"
```

Then you'll be prompted to enter:

```bash
Default client Region [None]: ap-southeast-2
CLI default output format (json if not specified) [None]:
Profile name [AdministratorAccess-123456789012]: dev-sso
```

What each means:

1. **Region** – Match your SSO region.
2. **Output format** – Press Enter to accept `json`.
3. **Profile name** – Use a short name like `dev-sso`.

---

## 🔐 Step 2: Log in via AWS SSO

To authenticate:

```bash
aws sso login --profile dev-sso
```

This command starts the login process and caches credentials. A browser may briefly open and complete authentication without further input. Once done, you're ready to use the CLI.

---

## 🧪 Step 3: Test the Profile

Run this to confirm setup:

```bash
aws sts get-caller-identity --profile dev-sso
```

This returns your AWS identity and confirms the profile is working.

---

## 🗘️ Optional: Set the Profile as Default

To make it default:

```bash
export AWS_PROFILE=dev-sso
```

Or add it to your shell config.

---

## 🔄 Re-login Before Expiry

Sessions expire after 8–12 hours. To re-login:

```bash
aws sso login --profile dev-sso
```

To check when your SSO credentials expire:

```bash
jq -r 'select(.startUrl | contains("dev-sso")) | .expiresAt' ~/.aws/sso/cache/*.json
```

This prints a timestamp like:

```text
2025-05-26T10:42:21UTC
```

---

## 🧼 To Remove a Profile

To fully delete a profile:

1. Open your AWS config files:

    ```bash
    nano ~/.aws/config
    nano ~/.aws/credentials
    ```

2. Remove the sections related to `[profile dev-sso]`.

There is no direct CLI command to delete a profile — editing the files manually is the correct way.

---

## ✅ Summary

With `aws configure sso`, you can:

* Avoid long-lived keys
* Log in securely to AWS accounts
* Use profiles easily from the CLI
