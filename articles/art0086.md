### Step 3: Choose Installation Location

Next, choose where Kiro should be installed on your system. By default, it installs under your user directory:

```plaintext

### Step 4: Select Start Menu Folder

Now choose where the Start Menu shortcuts should be placed. The default folder name is `Kiro`.

You can:

* Accept the default folder and click **Next**, or
* Check "Don't create a Start Menu folder" if you prefer not to create a shortcut

---

### Step 5: Select Additional Tasks

Choose any additional tasks you want Setup to perform during installation:

* [ ] Create a desktop icon
* [ ] Add "Open with Kiro" to the Windows Explorer file context menu
* [ ] Add "Open with Kiro" to the Windows Explorer directory context menu
* [x] Register Kiro as an editor for supported file types
* [x] Add to PATH (requires shell restart)

![Additional Tasks](https://github.com/jdevto/blog/raw/main/images/kiro-additional-tasks.png)

The last two options are selected by default, which is helpful for using Kiro from the terminal or as a default editor.

Click **Next** to continue.

---

### Step 6: Confirm Installation Settings

Before the actual installation begins, you'll see a summary of your chosen configuration:

* **Destination location**: where Kiro will be installed
* **Start Menu folder**: the folder name for shortcuts
* **Additional tasks**: any extra options selected

If everything looks correct, click **Install** to begin the installation. You can also click **Back** to review or change any previous steps.

### Step 7: Installing Kiro

The installer will now begin extracting files and installing Kiro on your system. This step may take a few moments.

Click **Finish** to exit the Setup Wizard. By default, the **Launch Kiro** option is checked, so Kiro will open immediately after closing the installer.

---

### Step 9: Sign In to Kiro

Once Kiro launches for the first time, you’ll be prompted to sign in. You can choose from several authentication methods:

* **Google**
* **GitHub**
* **AWS Builder ID**
* **Organization Identity**

Select the method that best suits your workflow to get started.

---

### Step 10: Import VS Code Configuration (Optional)

Kiro offers a convenient option to migrate your VS Code setup, including:

* Extensions (only those available on Open VSX)
* Keybindings
* Editor settings

You can choose to:

* **Import from VS Code** to keep your familiar setup
* **Skip** this step and proceed with a fresh Kiro environment

![Import Configuration](https://github.com/jdevto/blog/raw/main/images/kiro-import.png)

Kiro loads the extensions in the background so you can continue onboarding without delay.

---

### Step 11: Choose Your Theme

Personalize your Kiro experience by selecting a theme. You can choose between:

* **Kiro Dark**: A sleek, low-light theme great for long coding sessions
* **Kiro Light**: A clean, bright theme suitable for well-lit environments

![Choose Theme](https://github.com/jdevto/blog/raw/main/images/kiro-theme.png)

Once you've selected your preferred theme, click **Continue** to proceed.

---

### Step 12: Set Up Shell Integration

To complete the onboarding process, Kiro integrates with your system shell. This allows you to launch projects or files directly from the terminal using the `kiro` command.

![Set Up Shell](https://github.com/jdevto/blog/raw/main/images/kiro-shell.png)

You'll see a message confirming that the shell setup is complete. Click **Done** to finish the onboarding.

---

### Step 13: Welcome to Kiro

After onboarding is complete, you’ll land on Kiro’s home screen.

Here you can:

* **Open a project**: Load a local workspace to start coding immediately
* **Reconnect to a recent project**: If you've used Kiro before
* **Connect to a remote workspace**: For cloud development environments
