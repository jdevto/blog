## 🚀 AWS Session Manager: Secure Remote Access Without SSH

AWS Systems Manager (SSM) Session Manager enables **secure, keyless remote access** to EC2 instances **without requiring SSH, public IPs, or bastion hosts**. This feature simplifies remote instance management using AWS-managed networking and IAM-based authentication.

## 🔗 Key Benefits of AWS SSM Session Manager

- **No Public IPs Required** - Connect to instances inside private subnets.
- **No SSH Key Management** - Eliminates the need for manually managing SSH key pairs.
- **IAM-Based Access Control** - Grants secure, audited access via AWS IAM permissions.
- **No Need for Bastion Hosts** - Reduces infrastructure complexity and security risks.
- **AWS Console & CLI Integration** - Connect directly from AWS Console or via `aws ssm start-session`.
- **Session Logging & Auditing** - Tracks user activity for security and compliance.

## 🛠 Prerequisites

Before using AWS SSM Session Manager, ensure you have:

- **EC2 instance with SSM Agent installed** (Amazon Linux 2 has it by default; Amazon Linux 2023 requires installation).
- **IAM Role with `AmazonSSMManagedInstanceCore` attached**.
- **AWS CLI installed** ([Setup Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-cliv2.html)).
- **AWS SSM Session Manager Plugin installed** ([Installation Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/session-manager-working-with-install-plugin.html)).
- **Outbound internet access** (via NAT Gateway) or AWS PrivateLink for SSM endpoints.

## 🌐 How AWS SSM Session Manager Works

When a user initiates a session via **AWS Console or CLI**, AWS Systems Manager establishes a secure, **TLS-encrypted** session between the user and the instance. The **IAM policy** attached to the instance role controls permissions and access.

## 🚀 AWS SSM Session Manager for Private Subnets

AWS Systems Manager **Session Manager** allows access to instances in private subnets **without SSH or public IPs**.

### 🛠 How It Works

1. Attach an **IAM Role with `AmazonSSMManagedInstanceCore` policy** to the instance.
2. Ensure the instance has **SSM Agent installed and running**.
3. Use the AWS CLI or Console to initiate a session.
4. AWS handles authentication and communication securely.

## 📚 Terraform Sample Repository

For a working Terraform example demonstrating AWS SSM Session Manager, check out:

[**👉 GitHub Repository: AWS SSM Session Manager Terraform Demo**](git@github.com:jdevto/tf-aws-ec2-instance-session-manager-demo.git)

## 📊 IAM Policy Example

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "ssm:StartSession",
        "ssm:TerminateSession",
        "ssm:DescribeSessions",
        "ssm:GetConnectionStatus"
      ],
      "Resource": "*"
    }
  ]
}
```

## 📃 Common Issues & Fixes

### **❌ Instance Not Found in AWS SSM Session Manager**

✅ Ensure the **IAM Role includes `AmazonSSMManagedInstanceCore`**.
✅ Verify **SSM Agent is installed and running** (`systemctl status amazon-ssm-agent`).
✅ Ensure the instance has **outbound internet access** or **AWS SSM VPC Endpoints** configured.

### **❌ Session Manager Plugin Not Found**

✅ Install the AWS Session Manager Plugin:

#### **Debian/Ubuntu**

```sh
curl "https://s3.amazonaws.com/session-manager-downloads/plugin/latest/ubuntu_64bit/session-manager-plugin.deb" -o "session-manager-plugin.deb"
sudo dpkg -i session-manager-plugin.deb
```

#### **Amazon Linux 2 & RHEL 7**

```sh
sudo yum install -y https://s3.amazonaws.com/session-manager-downloads/plugin/latest/linux_64bit/session-manager-plugin.rpm
```

#### **Amazon Linux 2023 & RHEL 8/9**

```sh
sudo dnf install -y https://s3.amazonaws.com/session-manager-downloads/plugin/latest/linux_64bit/session-manager-plugin.rpm
```

#### **macOS**

```sh
curl "https://s3.amazonaws.com/session-manager-downloads/plugin/latest/mac/sessionmanager-bundle.zip" -o "sessionmanager-bundle.zip"
unzip sessionmanager-bundle.zip
sudo ./sessionmanager-bundle/install -i /usr/local/sessionmanagerplugin -b /usr/local/bin/session-manager-plugin
```

Verify installation:

```sh
session-manager-plugin --version
```
