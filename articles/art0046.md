## 🚀 Securely Connecting to Private EC2 Instances with EC2 Instance Connect Endpoint

Amazon EC2 Instance Connect Endpoint enables **secure, keyless SSH access** to private EC2 instances **without public IPs, bastion hosts, or VPNs**. This feature simplifies remote access management by leveraging AWS-managed networking and IAM-based authentication.

## 🔗 Key Benefits of EC2 Instance Connect Endpoint

- **No Public IPs Required** - Connect to instances inside private subnets.
- **No SSH Key Management** - Eliminates the need for manually managing SSH key pairs.
- **Secure IAM-Based Access** - Grants temporary SSH access via AWS IAM permissions.
- **No Need for Bastion Hosts** - Reduces complexity and security risks.
- **AWS Console & CLI Integration** - Connect directly from AWS Console or via `aws ec2-instance-connect ssh`.

## 📝 Prerequisites

Before using EC2 Instance Connect Endpoint, ensure you have:

- **An EC2 instance running a supported OS** (Amazon Linux 2, Ubuntu 20.04/22.04, Amazon Linux 2023 with manual setup).
- **AWS CLI installed** ([Setup Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-cliv2.html)).
- **Security group rules allowing inbound SSH (port 22) from the EC2 Instance Connect Endpoint.**

## 📝 Supported Operating Systems

EC2 Instance Connect Endpoint is **natively supported** on:

- **Amazon Linux 2**
- **Ubuntu 20.04 and 22.04**
- **Amazon Linux 2023 requires manual installation of EC2 Instance Connect but has been tested successfully.**

Other operating systems may work with additional configuration.

## 🌐 How EC2 Instance Connect Endpoint Works

When a user initiates an SSH session via **AWS Console or CLI**, AWS injects a **temporary SSH key** into the instance. This key is used for authentication and is valid **only for the duration of the session**.

## 🚀 EC2 Instance Connect Endpoint for Private Subnets

AWS introduced **EC2 Instance Connect Endpoints** to enable access to EC2 instances **inside private subnets** without requiring public IPs, bastion hosts, or VPNs.

### 🛠 How It Works

1. Deploy an **EC2 Instance Connect Endpoint** inside the **same subnet** as the instance.
2. Assign a **Security Group** to control access.
3. Ensure the instance has **EC2 Instance Connect Agent installed and running**.
4. Use the AWS CLI or Console to initiate a connection.

## 📚 Terraform Sample Repository

For a working Terraform example demonstrating EC2 Instance Connect Endpoint, check out:

[**👉 GitHub Repository: EC2 Instance Connect Endpoint Terraform Demo**](https://github.com/jdevto/tf-aws-ec2-instance-connect-endpoint-demo)

### ⚠️ Common Pitfalls in Terraform Configuration

#### 1️⃣ Security Groups Must Allow SSH Traffic

- The **EC2 Instance Security Group** must allow SSH (port 22) from the **EC2 Instance Connect Endpoint Security Group**.
- If using an **EC2 Instance Connect Endpoint**, allow traffic **only from the endpoint's security group**.

#### 2️⃣ Amazon Linux 2023 Requires Manual EC2 Instance Connect Installation

- Install EC2 Instance Connect manually:

  ```sh
  sudo yum install -y ec2-instance-connect
  ```

  - Ensure the service is running:

  ```sh
  systemctl enable --now ec2-instance-connect
  ```

## 🔍 Troubleshooting EC2 Instance Connect Endpoint Issues

### **❌ Cannot Connect via EC2 Instance Connect Endpoint**

✅ Ensure the **EC2 instance security group allows SSH (port 22) from the EC2 Instance Connect Endpoint security group**.
✅ **Instance must be in the same subnet as the EC2 Instance Connect Endpoint**.
✅ **Use the correct AWS CLI command with `aws ec2-instance-connect ssh --instance-id`**.

### **❌ "Instance is Not Reachable" Error**

✅ Confirm that **EC2 Instance Connect Agent is installed and running** (`systemctl status ec2-instance-connect` on Amazon Linux 2023).
✅ The instance must have **outbound internet connectivity** (NAT Gateway or AWS PrivateLink required for package updates).

## 📈 Summary

EC2 Instance Connect Endpoint provides **secure, keyless SSH access** to private EC2 instances, eliminating the need for **public IPs, bastion hosts, or VPNs**.
