Amazon EKS on Fargate gives you serverless pods — but you still need logs!
This guide walks you through enabling logging **visually** and **minimally** using Terraform.

---

## 📘 Why This Matters

By default, Amazon EKS on Fargate doesn’t log application output. You must opt-in using Fluent Bit — a log router that reads from `/var/log/containers` and pushes logs to CloudWatch. All you need is:

- EKS cluster using Fargate
- Pod execution IAM role
- Terraform

---

## 📦 Step 1: Create Logging Namespace

```hcl
resource "kubernetes_namespace" "aws_observability" {
  metadata {
    name = "aws-observability"
    labels = {
      "aws-observability" = "enabled"
    }
  }
}
```

---

## 📝 Step 2: Add Fluent Bit ConfigMap

Fluent Bit automatically detects this ConfigMap if it's named `aws-logging` and placed in the `aws-observability` namespace.

Make sure it contains valid `[FILTER]` and `[OUTPUT]` sections only. Avoid `[INPUT]` or `[SERVICE]` blocks — they are managed by AWS.

```hcl
resource "kubernetes_config_map" "aws_logging" {
  metadata {
    name      = "aws-logging"
    namespace = kubernetes_namespace.aws_observability.metadata[0].name
  }

  data = {
    "filters.conf" = <<-EOT
      [FILTER]
          Name kubernetes
          Match logging-enabled.*
          Merge_Log On
          Keep_Log Off
    EOT

    "output.conf" = <<-EOT
      [OUTPUT]
          Name cloudwatch_logs
          Match logging-enabled.*
          region ap-southeast-1
          log_group_name /aws/eks/my-cluster/logs
          log_stream_prefix from-fluent-bit-
          auto_create_group true
    EOT
  }
}
```

---

## 🏷️ Step 3: Annotate Pods to Enable Logging

Add the following annotations to opt your pod in for logging. These control whether Fluent Bit processes logs and which tag it uses for matching.

> 🧠 `fluentbit.io/tag` must match the `Match` pattern in your ConfigMap.

```hcl
annotations = {
  "eks.amazonaws.com/enable-logging" = "true"
  "fluentbit.io/tag"                 = "logging-enabled.nginx"
}
```

---

## 🔐 Step 4: IAM Role Policy

```hcl
resource "aws_iam_role_policy" "fargate_logging" {
  name = "EKSFargateLogging"
  role = aws_iam_role.fargate_execution.name

  policy = jsonencode({
    Version = "2012-10-17",
    Statement = [
      {
        Sid      = "CreateLogGroup",
        Effect   = "Allow",
        Action   = "logs:CreateLogGroup",
        Resource = "arn:aws:logs:ap-southeast-2:123456789012:log-group:/aws/eks/my-cluster/logs"
      },
      {
        Sid    = "StreamAndPutLogs",
        Effect = "Allow",
        Action = [
          "logs:CreateLogStream",
          "logs:PutLogEvents",
          "logs:DescribeLogStreams"
        ],
        Resource = "arn:aws:logs:ap-southeast-2:123456789012:log-group:/aws/eks/my-cluster/logs:*"
      }
    ]
  })
}
```

## ✅ Verify Logging

📌 **Check pod logging status:**

```bash
kubectl describe pod <pod-name>
```

Look for:
`Logging: Successfully enabled logging for pod`

📌 **Check CloudWatch Logs:**
Go to: `CloudWatch > Log groups > /aws/eks/my-cluster/logs`

📌 **List pods and tail logs:**

```bash
kubectl get pods
kubectl logs <pod-name>
```

📌 Check pod status:

```bash
kubectl describe pod <pod-name>
```

Look for:
`Logging: Successfully enabled logging for pod`

📌 View logs:

- CloudWatch: `/aws/eks/my-cluster/logs`
- CLI: `kubectl logs <pod-name>`

---

## 🧪 Troubleshooting

- ✅ ConfigMap must be < 5300 characters
- ✅ Use only `[FILTER]`, `[OUTPUT]`, `[PARSER]`
- 🔁 Restart pods for config changes to apply

---

## 🎯 Done

With logging set up per pod using Terraform, you now have fine-grained control and visibility into your EKS Fargate workloads.

Minimal config. Maximum observability. 💡
