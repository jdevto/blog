## 💡 Building a DevContainer Feature for Amazon Q CLI (Inspired by a Kiwi Memory Game)

While experimenting with [Amazon Q CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codewhisperer/latest/userguide/amazon-q-cli.html), I stumbled upon a small but persistent friction point: **getting it installed in a Dev Container every time**.

So I solved it.

This is the story of building a memory game with Amazon Q, the packaging challenge I ran into, and how I solved it with a custom [Dev Container Feature](https://containers.dev/features) published on GitHub Container Registry (GHCR).

### 🎮 The Project: Q Kiwi Memory Game

I wanted to test how far I could go using [Amazon Q CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codewhisperer/latest/userguide/amazon-q-cli.html) as a pair programmer. So I started a fun little repo called:

👉 [**q-kiwi-memory-game**](https://github.com/jajera/q-kiwi-memory-game)

It's a simple memory game powered by HTML/JS, designed with a clean goal: **build entirely with Q CLI prompting**.

I used the CLI to generate functions, refactor layout, and even tune CSS. The experience was surprisingly smooth… but only *after* I sorted out the environment.

### 📊 The Problem: Reinstalling Q CLI Every Time

Amazon Q CLI isn't bundled in standard containers or features. And since [Dev Containers](https://containers.dev/) are ephemeral or rebuilt often, I kept hitting the same pain:

> “Why do I have to install Amazon Q CLI manually every single time?”

This broke flow. And since I love DevContainers for isolated development, I needed a better way.

### ✨ The Solution: DevContainer Feature for Amazon Q CLI

So I built this:

👉 [`ghcr.io/jajera/features/amazon-q-cli:1`](https://github.com/jajera/features/pkgs/container/features%2Famazon-q-cli)

This is a **Dev Container Feature** that installs the Amazon Q CLI into your environment, automatically.

You just reference it in your `.devcontainer.json`:

```json
{
  "name": "With Amazon Q CLI",
  "features": {
    "ghcr.io/jajera/features/amazon-q-cli:1": {}
  }
}
```

That’s it. Rebuild your Dev Container, and you're ready to run:

```bash
q help
```

📅 No more `curl && tar && sudo mv`.

### 🔧 Under the Hood

The feature is built using the [containers.dev feature spec](https://containers.dev/implementors/features/), packaged and published via [GHCR](https://ghcr.io).

Repo: [github.com/jajera/features](https://github.com/jajera/features)
Image: [`ghcr.io/jajera/features/amazon-q-cli`](https://github.com/jajera/features/pkgs/container/features%2Famazon-q-cli)

The install script handles downloading the latest version of Q CLI from AWS, sets it in your path, and ensures it's ready for use as soon as your container starts.

### 🧬 Why This Matters

If you're experimenting with AI coding tools like Amazon Q CLI, you want your setup to be frictionless. This makes it:

* ✅ Easy to onboard
* ✅ Reproducible for teams
* ✅ Quick to rebuild without reinstall hell

Combine it with GitHub Codespaces or VS Code Remote Containers, and you’ve got a ready-to-code AI-enhanced playground in seconds.

### 🌟 Final Thoughts

Packaging up the Amazon Q CLI as a DevContainer feature wasn't just a convenience—it's the kind of developer quality-of-life improvement that keeps flow going.

If you're building with Amazon Q or just want a smooth setup experience, I hope this helps.

👉 Game on.
🚀 Happy building.
