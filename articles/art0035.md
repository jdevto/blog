## AWS Multi-Session Support: Seamlessly Switch Between Accounts

AWS has introduced **multi-session support** in the AWS Management Console, enabling users to sign in to multiple AWS accounts or roles within the same browser.

### Key Features

- **Concurrent Sessions** â€“ Sign in to up to **five different AWS identities** (IAM, root, or federated roles) at the same time.
- **Separate Console Instances** â€“ Each session runs in its own tab, maintaining session isolation.
- **Unique Subdomains** â€“ Each session has a distinct URL for better organization and security.

### How to Enable Multi-Session Support

1. **Opt-in to Multi-Session:**
   - Click on your **account name** in the AWS Console navigation bar.
   - Select **"Turn on multi-session support"**.

2. **Add a New Session:**
   - Click **"Add session"** and choose **"Sign in"**.
   - A new tab opens where you can enter credentials for another AWS account or role.

3. **Easily Switch Between Sessions:**
   - Each session operates in its own tab with a unique AWS Console subdomain.

### Important Notes

- Multi-session support is currently only available to a limited number of user accounts.
- Supports **up to 5 concurrent sessions**.
- Browser-specific â€“ needs to be enabled per browser.
- **Update bookmarks** to reflect unique session URLs.

AWSâ€™s multi-session support enhances productivity, especially for users managing multiple AWS environments (e.g., **development, testing, production**). No more logging in and out repeatedly!
