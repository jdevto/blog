## What Is Kiro AWS?

Kiro AWS is a next-generation IDE designed specifically for cloud developers building on AWS. It combines the power of AI with a chat-driven workflow to help you create, manage, and iterate on AWS infrastructure and applications faster than ever.

---

### A Developer IDE, Reimagined

Kiro isn't just a code editor â€” itâ€™s an **agentic IDE** that works with you to plan, scaffold, and manage real AWS projects.

You can:

* Chat with Kiro to generate infrastructure and application code
* Automatically scaffold AWS resources using natural language
* Preview and modify generated code in real time
* Execute and manage deployments directly within the IDE

---

### The Two Modes: Vibe vs. Spec

Kiroâ€™s approach is centered around **how** you prefer to work:

---

### Vibe Mode (Chat First)

* Great for exploration and discovery
* Perfect when requirements are unclear
* Type in a goal (e.g., "Set up a Lambda with API Gateway") and let Kiro walk you through it interactively

---

#### Spec Mode (Plan First)

* Great for larger or production projects
* Start with requirements, constraints, and architecture
* Kiro then generates code and infra based on those specs

### Showcase: Creating a Static Website with S3 in Vibe

Letâ€™s say you want to create and deploy a static website using S3. In Vibe mode, just type:

```plaintext
I want to create a static website on AWS using S3, and make it public. The content of the site should showcase what AWS Kiro IDE is, how it works, and its unique features.
```

It took a few prompts and a small tweak to `deploy-to-s3.md` before the site uploaded properly.

Kiro generated everything â€” no coding needed. The result was a basic, non-functional site, but it worked. You keep refining until it does what you need.

All from within the IDE â€” no console hopping or switching tools.

### AWS Native Integration

Kiro supports seamless AWS integration:

* Authenticate using Builder ID, IAM Role, or credentials
* Browse and manage your AWS resources visually
* Deploy infrastructure using CDK, SAM, or Terraform
* Use built-in templates or let Kiro build from scratch

---

### Try It Yourself

Whether youâ€™re new to AWS or building production-grade systems, Kiro helps you:

* Move faster from idea to execution
* Reduce boilerplate and copy-paste fatigue
* Learn AWS concepts naturally as you go

Kiro isnâ€™t just an IDE. Itâ€™s your AWS development co-pilot.

### Final Thoughts

Kiro is still in **preview**, and while it shows huge potential, it currently lacks some features found in more mature IDEs. That said, its agentic, chat-first experience is unique â€” and itâ€™s clear the platform is evolving fast.

If you're curious about where cloud IDEs are headed, it's worth keeping an eye on this one.\*
