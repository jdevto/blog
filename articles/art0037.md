## Introduction

Unraid allows you to create shared folders, commonly referred to as "shares," which can be accessed over the network. In this guide, we will use `isos` as an example, but these steps apply to any share you configure in Unraid.

## Steps

### 1. Access Share Permissions

- Log in to **Unraid Web GUI** (`http://your-unraid-ip`).
- Navigate to **Shares**.
- Select the desired share (e.g., `isos`).

### 2. Modify Share Settings

- Under **Share Settings**, configure:
  - **Primary Storage**: Choose between `Array`, `Cache`, or `Both`.
  - **Secondary Storage**: Optional for tiered storage.
  - **Allocation Method**: `High-water`, `Most-free`, or `Fill-up`.
  - **Split Level**: Determines file distribution across disks.
  - **Included/Excluded Disks**: Define which disks store the share.
- Click **Apply** to save changes.

### 3. Configure SMB Security Settings and Assign User Permissions

- Scroll to **SMB Security Settings**.
- Under **Export**, select:
  - `No`: Share is not accessible over the network.
  - `Yes (Hidden)`: Share is available but does not appear in network discovery.
  - `Yes`: Share is accessible and visible.
- Under **Security**, select:
  - `Public`: Anyone can access without credentials.
  - `Secure`: Users need credentials, but guest access is read-only.
  - `Private`: Only specified users can access.
- Click **Apply** to save changes.

- Once you save the SMB settings and select `Secure` or `Private`, a **User Access Management** popup will appear.
- Assign user permissions in this popup:
  - **Read-only**: User can view but not modify files.
  - **Read/Write**: User can view and modify files.
  - **No Access**: User cannot access the share.
- Click **Apply** in the popup to save changes.

### 4. Verify Access

- Connect to the **Unraid server** from the userâ€™s machine using SMB:
  - **Windows**: `Win + R`, enter `\\your-unraid-ip\sharename`, and press Enter.
  - **Mac/Linux**: Use Finder or run:

    ```bash
    smbclient //your-unraid-ip/sharename -U username
    ```

- Enter the credentials and verify the access level.

## Conclusion

Configuring share permissions properly ensures secure access control in Unraid. Always assign permissions based on user needs and avoid setting critical shares to `Public`. Happy Unraiding!
