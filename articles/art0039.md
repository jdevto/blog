## Introduction

SSH (Secure Shell) allows remote access to your Ubuntu server for administration, development, and troubleshooting. This guide walks you through enabling SSH on an Ubuntu server.

## Steps

### 1. Update Package Lists

Before installing SSH, update your package lists:

```bash
sudo apt update
```

### 2. Install OpenSSH Server

Install the SSH server package to allow remote connections:

```bash
sudo apt install -y openssh-server
```

### 3. Start and Enable the SSH Service

Once installed, start and enable SSH to run at boot:

```bash
sudo systemctl enable --now ssh
```

### 4. Verify SSH is Running

Check the status of the SSH service:

```bash
sudo systemctl status ssh
```

If running, you should see output similar to:

```plaintext
Active: active (running)
```

### 5. Find Your Serverâ€™s IP Address

To connect remotely, find your server's IP address:

```bash
ip a
```

Look for an IP under `eth0` or `ensXX` (e.g., `192.168.X.X`).

### 6. Connect via SSH

From another computer, use this command to connect:

```bash
ssh username@server-ip
```

Replace `username` with your Ubuntu username and `server-ip` with the IP found in Step 5.

### 7. Configure Firewall (If Needed)

If you are using **UFW**, allow SSH traffic:

```bash
sudo ufw allow ssh
```

## Conclusion

You have successfully enabled SSH on your Ubuntu server. This allows secure remote access for managing your system. ðŸš€
