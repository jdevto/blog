## The Mystery of the 🪄 Malformed S3 Authorization Header

Spent over an hour debugging a simple Terraform setup. It wasn’t Terraform’s fault. It wasn’t my AWS provider config. It was… S3's "bucket name memory" 🤯

---

## ❓ What Happened

* ✅ I had a working CloudTrail setup in `ap-southeast-1`
* 🗑️ I deleted the S3 bucket
* 🔁 Tried to recreate same name in `us-east-1`
* 💥 Got this error:

```plaintext
AuthorizationHeaderMalformed: The authorization header is malformed; the region 'us-east-1' is wrong; expecting 'ap-southeast-1'
```

---

## 🔍 Root Cause

* 🪣 **S3 remembers** deleted bucket names and their **original region**
* 🌐 **S3 bucket names are global** — reused names trigger region conflicts
* 🧠 AWS internally caches bucket-region mappings
* 📛 Even though the bucket was deleted, S3 still linked that name to the original region

---

## ✅ What Fixed It

* I renamed the bucket: `-test1` added → it worked instantly
* No region conflict

---

## 💡 Lesson

When switching regions:

* 🆕 Use **new bucket names**
* 🧹 Or **wait hours/days** for AWS to fully purge name mapping
* 🧭 Don’t assume a deleted bucket is gone from AWS memory

---

## 🧵 Why This Matters

* ⏳ I wasted time chasing provider settings
* 🧩 Error message was misleading
* 🔁 Easy to run into during region migrations or reuse

Hope this saves someone a few hours! ⏱️
