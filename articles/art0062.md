## 📘 Introduction

When it comes to logging in Amazon EKS, two of the most popular tools are **Fluent Bit** and **Fluentd**. Both are powerful log forwarders that can collect, filter, and route logs from your Kubernetes workloads to various destinations, such as CloudWatch, S3, Elasticsearch, or third-party observability platforms.

This guide provides a visual comparison of Fluent Bit vs Fluentd and offers best practices for using them in your EKS cluster.

## 🤔 Choosing the Right Tool

| Use Fluent Bit if...                        | Use Fluentd if...                                      |
| ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| ✅ You're using **Fargate**                  | ✅ You're on **EC2-based nodes** and need flexibility   |
| ✅ You want **lightweight and fast** logging | ✅ You need **advanced filtering or routing**           |
| ✅ You prefer **AWS-managed add-ons**        | ✅ You're already using Fluentd elsewhere in your stack |

## 🚀 **Deployment** Models

### Fluent Bit (EKS Add-on or Helm)

Fluent Bit can be deployed via the official AWS EKS add-on for minimal setup or manually using a Helm chart for more control over configuration.

### Fluentd (DaemonSet Deployment)

Fluentd is typically deployed as a DaemonSet using a generic Kubernetes manifest. You’ll need to select a suitable image and provide your own configuration files to define input sources and output destinations.

## ✅ Best Practices

- 🧩 Use structured logging (e.g., JSON)
- 🔐 Assign least-privilege IAM roles to logging agents
- 🧼 Keep logging agents separate from app containers
- 🚦 Filter noisy logs to reduce CloudWatch costs
- 📤 Route logs based on namespace or label

---

## 🧾 Summary

Both Fluent Bit and Fluentd are great options for EKS logging, depending on your needs:

- **Fluent Bit** is fast, lightweight, and works seamlessly with AWS-native solutions — ideal for most users.
- **Fluentd** is a full-featured logging router with deep plugin support — great for advanced pipelines.

Choose the tool that fits your workload, and don’t hesitate to mix both in multi-node-type environments.

Happy logging! 📁
