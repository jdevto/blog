## Sync GitHub User or  Organization Repositories with a Simple Script

Keeping all repositories in a GitHub organization updated can be a tedious task, especially when working with multiple repositories. With a simple Bash script, you can automate the process of cloning and syncing all repositories in your organization. This article walks you through the script and how it works.

### Why Automate Repository Syncing?

Manually cloning and pulling updates for multiple repositories is time-consuming and prone to errors. Automating this process offers the following benefits:

- Time-Saving: Quickly fetch and update all repositories without manual intervention.
- Consistency: Ensure every repository is up to date across local and remote systems.
- Efficiency: Handle repositories with minimal effort using Git and the GitHub API.

### The Script: Clone and Sync Repositories

Here's the script to automate cloning and syncing repositories:

```bash
GITHUB_ORG=jdevto
BASE_DIR="." 

# Create the base directory
mkdir $GITHUB_ORG
cd $GITHUB_ORG

# Function to clone or sync a repository
sync_repo() {
  local repo_url="$1"
  local repo_name=$(basename "$repo_url" .git)
  local repo_dir="$BASE_DIR/$repo_name"

  if [ -d "$repo_dir" ]; then
    echo "Updating $repo_name..."
    git -C "$repo_dir" pull --rebase
  else
    echo "Cloning $repo_name..."
    git clone "$repo_url" "$repo_dir"
  fi
}

# Fetch repositories from GitHub API
echo "Fetching repositories for organization: $GITHUB_ORG..."
page=1

# Loop through each repository and sync it
while true; do
  repos=$(curl -s "https://api.github.com/orgs/$GITHUB_ORG/repos?per_page=100&page=$page" | jq -r '.[].ssh_url')
  [ -z "$repos" ] && break
  for repo_url in $repos; do
    sync_repo "$repo_url"
  done
  ((page++))
done
```

### How It Works

1. Setup Organization and Base Directory

    - The GITHUB_ORG variable holds your organization or GitHub user name (e.g., jdevto).
    - The BASE_DIR variable determines where repositories will be cloned or updated.

2. Clone or Sync Repositories

    - The sync_repo function checks if a repository exists locally.
    - If found, it updates the repository using git pull --rebase. Otherwise, it clones the repository.

3. Fetch Repository List

    - Using the GitHub API, the script fetches a list of repositories from the organization in pages of 100.
    - The script loops through all repositories and calls sync_repo for each.

### Prerequisites

Before using the script, ensure the following:

- Git Installed: The script uses Git commands like git clone and git pull.
- GitHub API Access: The script fetches repositories using GitHub's REST API. If your organization has private repositories, configure authentication (e.g., with a Personal Access Token).
- jq Installed: This script uses jq to parse JSON responses from the API.

### How to Use the Script

1. Save the script as sync_repos.sh
2. Make it executable

    ```bash
    chmod +x sync_repos.sh
    ```

3. Run the script

    ```bash
    ./sync_repos.sh
    ```

### Key Takeaways

- Automating repetitive tasks like syncing repositories saves time and reduces errors.
- The GitHub API makes it easy to interact with your organization's repositories programmatically.
- With small tweaks, this script can handle additional tasks like branch switching or archiving inactive repositories.

Now, your GitHub repositories are always in sync with just one command! Happy automating!
