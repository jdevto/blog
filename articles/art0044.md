## How to Tag and Push a Private GitHub Container Image

GitHub Container Registry (GHCR) allows you to store and manage private container images. This guide covers logging in, pulling an image, tagging it, and pushing it to GHCR.

### **1. Login to GitHub CLI with Appropriate Permissions**

To authenticate with GitHub and ensure you have the required permissions (`write:packages`), run:

```sh
gh auth login --scopes write:packages
```

This command will prompt you with interactive options:

1. **Where do you use GitHub?**
   - Choose `GitHub.com` unless you are using an enterprise instance.
2. **What is your preferred protocol for Git operations on this host?**
   - Choose `HTTPS` for a password/token-based login.
   - Choose `SSH` if you use SSH keys for authentication.
3. **Authenticate Git with your GitHub credentials:**
   - If using `HTTPS`, provide your GitHub **Personal Access Token (PAT)**.
   - If using `SSH`, ensure your public key is added to GitHub.

Alternatively, you can log in to GHCR directly using this method, which avoids the interactive prompts of `gh auth login` and can be useful for automation or CI/CD pipelines:

```sh
echo $(gh auth token) | docker login ghcr.io -u $(gh api user --jq .login) --password-stdin
```

### **2. Pull the Private Image**

If you have an existing private image in GHCR that you want to tag, pull it first:

```sh
docker pull ghcr.io/YOUR_ORG_OR_USER/your-image:latest
```

Replace `YOUR_ORG_OR_USER` with your GitHub username or organization name.

### **3. Tag the Image**

Once you have the image, tag it appropriately before pushing:

```sh
docker tag your-image:latest ghcr.io/YOUR_ORG_OR_USER/your-image:new-tag
```

Replace `new-tag` with the desired tag (e.g., `v1.0.0`).

### **4. Push the Image to GHCR**

Push the tagged image to GHCR:

```sh
docker push ghcr.io/YOUR_ORG_OR_USER/your-image:new-tag
```

### **5. Verify the Pushed Image**

To check if your image is successfully pushed, run:

```sh
docker pull ghcr.io/YOUR_ORG_OR_USER/your-image:new-tag
```

or visit GitHub Packages under your repository to view the image.

### **Final Thoughts**

Managing private container images on GHCR is straightforward with GitHub CLI and Docker commands. By following these steps, you can securely store, tag, and push your images with ease.
