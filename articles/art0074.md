## AWS IAM Identity Center Setup Guide: Secure Console Access Without IAM Users

Setting up a secure AWS environment is critical from day one. This guide walks you through configuring **AWS IAM Identity Center (formerly AWS SSO)** to enable secure, free console access without creating IAM users or using the root account for daily operations.

---

## ✨ Why Use IAM Identity Center?

* ❌ Avoids insecure IAM user passwords
* ✅ Built-in support for MFA and federated login
* ✅ Free to use for internal users
* ✅ Scalable, audit-friendly, and aligned with AWS best practices

---

## ✅ Prerequisites

* Access to the AWS root account (used once only)
* MFA enabled on the root account (strongly recommended)
* AWS Management Console access

---

## 🔧 Step 1: Enable IAM Identity Center

1. Go to the **IAM Identity Center** service in the AWS Console
2. Click **Enable**
3. Keep the default identity source (**Identity Center directory**) unless integrating with an external IdP
4. Confirm identity source when prompted

---

## 📅 Step 2: Create an Admin User

1. Navigate to **IAM Identity Center → Users**
2. Click **Add user**
3. Enter:

   * Name: `Admin`
   * Email: your desired admin email (can be same as the AWS account email)
4. Leave groups blank (optional)
5. Click **Create user**

The user will receive an email invitation to set a password.

---

## 📄 Step 3: Create a Permission Set

1. Go to **IAM Identity Center → Permission sets**
2. Click **Create permission set**
3. Choose **AWS managed policy**
4. Select **AdministratorAccess**
5. Leave other settings default and create the set

---

## 🏦 Step 4: Assign the User to Your AWS Account

1. Go to **IAM Identity Center → AWS accounts**
2. Select your AWS account by checking the box
3. Click **Assign users or groups**
4. Choose the admin user created earlier
5. Select the **AdministratorAccess** permission set
6. Click **Submit**

---

## 🌐 Step 5: Log In via Access Portal

1. Visit your IAM Identity Center user portal URL (found in **Settings**)

   * Example: `https://d-abc123.awsapps.com/start`
2. Log in using the email and password created in the email invite
3. You should now see a tile for your AWS account
4. Click **Management Console** to access the AWS Console as an administrator

---

## ⚡ Optional But Recommended

### Enable MFA Globally

* Go to **IAM Identity Center → Settings → Multi-factor authentication**
* Require MFA for all users

### Enable CloudTrail

* Go to **CloudTrail** and create a trail for management events
* Free tier covers this

### Remove Root Access Keys (if any)

* Go to **IAM → Users**
* Delete any root access keys
* Store root password securely and use only for rare account-level actions

---

## 🚀 You're Done

You now have:

* ✅ Secure, MFA-enabled AWS console access
* ✅ No IAM users with passwords
* ✅ Fully free-tier compliant setup
* ✅ Safe root account usage practices

This setup is suitable for personal, test, and even production AWS accounts.
