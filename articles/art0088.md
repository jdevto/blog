## How to Enable SSH on Ubuntu (Step-by-Step Guide)

Enabling SSH on Ubuntu is essential if you want to manage your machine remotely or automate deployments. In this guide, we’ll walk through how to set it up securely.

---

### 1. Install the OpenSSH Server

Run the following commands to update package lists and install the OpenSSH server:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install openssh-server -y
```

This installs the SSH service and its dependencies.

---

### 2. Enable and Start the SSH Service

After installation, enable and start the SSH service so it runs on boot:

```bash
sudo systemctl enable ssh
sudo systemctl start ssh
```

You can verify the service is running:

```bash
sudo systemctl status ssh
```

Look for **active (running)** in the output.

---

### 3. Allow SSH Through the Firewall (Optional)

If you’re using UFW (Uncomplicated Firewall), you’ll need to allow SSH traffic:

```bash
sudo ufw allow ssh
sudo ufw reload
```

This opens port **22** for incoming SSH connections.

---

### 4. Test Your SSH Connection

From another machine, connect to your Ubuntu system using:

```bash
ssh your-username@your-ubuntu-ip
```

Replace `your-username` with your Ubuntu username and `your-ubuntu-ip` with the machine’s IP address.

---

### 5. (Recommended) Harden Your SSH Setup

For better security, consider:

* **Using SSH keys** instead of passwords.
* **Disabling root login** via SSH by editing `/etc/ssh/sshd_config`.
* **Changing the default SSH port** to reduce automated attacks.

After making changes to `sshd_config`, restart SSH:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart ssh
```

### Final Thoughts

That’s it! You’ve successfully enabled SSH on Ubuntu. With SSH running, you can now remotely administer your server, deploy code, and use tools like Ansible or Git to manage your machine more efficiently.
