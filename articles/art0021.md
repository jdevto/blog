## How to Set Git user.name and user.email Based on the Most Recent Commit

Have you ever used a new system or environment to update your repository, only to encounter this dreaded message when trying to commit?

```markdown
Author identity unknown

*** Please tell me who you are.
```

This can happen when Git doesn’t recognize your identity because `user.name` and `user.email` aren’t configured. It’s frustrating, especially when you're in the middle of a critical update. This is something you likely won’t remember off the top of your head, and you just want to ensure that the new configuration is exactly what it needs to be. However, keep in mind that this method works only if you were the last person to make a commit in the repository.

### 1. Get the Author of the Most Recent Commit

To extract the name and email of the author of the most recent commit, run the following commands in your repository:

#### For Name

```bash
git log -1 --pretty=format:'%an'
```

#### For Email

```bash
git log -1 --pretty=format:'%ae'
```

These commands will output the name and email of the author of the most recent commit. For example:

- Name: `John Doe`
- Email: `johndoe@example.com`

---

### 2. Use These Details Globally

Once you have the author details, you can set them as your global Git configuration. Run the following commands:

```bash
git config --global user.name "$(git log -1 --pretty=format:'%an')"
git config --global user.email "$(git log -1 --pretty=format:'%ae')"
```

This dynamically sets the global `user.name` and `user.email` to match the author details from the most recent commit.

---

### Why This is Useful

- **Avoiding Errors:** Prevents commit interruptions caused by missing identity configurations.
- **Consistency:** Ensures that your commits align with the identity of the last contributor.
- **Collaboration:** Helpful in team environments where multiple developers might share a machine or repository.
- **Convenience:** Quickly updates Git configurations without manually typing the details.

---

### Notes

- Ensure you run these commands in a repository with existing commits.
- If you need these settings locally (only for the current repository), remove the `--global` flag:

```bash
git config user.name "$(git log -1 --pretty=format:'%an')"
git config user.email "$(git log -1 --pretty=format:'%ae')"
```

- To verify your new Git configuration, use:

```bash
git config --list
```

With this approach, you can easily align your Git user configuration with the most recent commit in your project. Say goodbye to those "Author identity unknown" interruptions and enjoy a smoother development workflow. Let me know in the comments if you found this helpful or have additional tips to share!
