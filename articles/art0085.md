When using **Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL)** on cloud or virtual machines, such as EC2 instances, you need to register the system with Red Hat to access software repositories. This registration can be done in two ways:

* Using your Red Hat username and password
* Using an **activation key** tied to your Red Hat Developer subscription

For automation, CI/CD, or cloud-init provisioning, using an **activation key** is the recommended and secure method.

This guide walks you through how to generate an activation key and register your RHEL system using the **Red Hat Hybrid Cloud Console**.

## üß∞ Prerequisites

* A Red Hat Developer account: [https://developers.redhat.com/register](https://developers.redhat.com/register)
* Access to the Red Hat Hybrid Cloud Console: [https://console.redhat.com/](https://console.redhat.com/)

## üîç Step 1: Retrieve Your Org ID and Account Number

1. Go to [https://console.redhat.com/](https://console.redhat.com/)
2. Click your profile icon in the top-right corner
3. In the dropdown menu, locate your **Account number** and **Org ID**
4. Note down the **Org ID** ‚Äî this will be used in the registration command

## üîê Step 2: Create an Activation Key

To access the activation key section:

1. At [https://console.redhat.com/](https://console.redhat.com/), use the top search bar and type `subscriptions`
2. Click **Subscriptions Inventory**
3. Under **Getting started resources**, click **Activate a subscription**
4. Click **Create Activation Key** and follow the wizard:

* **Name and Description**: Enter a unique name (e.g., `rhel-subscription`)
* **Workload**: Choose `Latest release` (or `Extended support releases` for LTS needs)
* **System Purpose**: Set `Usage` to `Development/Test`. Leave `Role` and `SLA` as `Not defined`
* **Review** and click **Create**

## üì¶ Step 3: Add Additional Repositories (Optional)

By default, core repositories like **BaseOS** and **AppStream** are enabled. However, you can add more via:

1. From the Activation Key list, click your activation key name
2. Scroll to **Additional repositories** and click **Add repositories**
3. Use the search bar to locate and select repositories based on your requirements
4. Click **Save Changes**

---

## üíª Step 4: Register Your RHEL System

Use the following command on your RHEL 8 or RHEL 9 instance:

```bash
sudo subscription-manager register \
  --org="<your-org-id>" \
  --activationkey="rhel-subscription"
```

Example:

```bash
sudo subscription-manager register \
  --org="12345678" \
  --activationkey="rhel-subscription"
```

To enable a repository manually (if not selected during activation key setup):

```bash
sudo subscription-manager repos --enable="codeready-builder-for-rhel-9-x86_64-rpms"
```

List all available repositories:

```bash
sudo subscription-manager repos --list
```

---

## ‚úÖ Step 5: Verify Registration

Check if your system is registered and repositories are active:

```bash
sudo subscription-manager status
sudo dnf repolist
```

You should see a valid subscription and enabled repositories.

## üß© Summary

Using the **Hybrid Cloud Console** and an **activation key** tied to your Red Hat Developer account provides a clean, automated way to register RHEL systems. This is especially useful in cloud or ephemeral environments where manual activation isn't practical.

Enjoy automating your RHEL setup with ease!
