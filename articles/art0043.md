## How to Configure SSH for GitHub Authentication on Windows

Secure Shell (SSH) authentication is the recommended way to securely connect to GitHub repositories without needing to enter your credentials every time. In this guide, you'll learn how to configure SSH authentication for GitHub on Windows step by step.

### Step 1: Check for Existing SSH Keys

Before generating a new SSH key, check if you already have one. Open **PowerShell** and run:

```powershell
ls ~\.ssh
```

If you see files like `id_rsa` and `id_rsa.pub`, you already have an SSH key. You can use the existing key or generate a new one.

### Step 2: Generate a New SSH Key

If you don’t have an SSH key or want a new one, generate it using:

```powershell
ssh-keygen -o -a 100 -t ed25519 -f $env:USERPROFILE\.ssh\id_ed25519_github -C "ssh key for github"
```

If your system doesn’t support `ed25519`, use:

```powershell
ssh-keygen -o -a 100 -t rsa -b 4096 -m PEM -f $env:USERPROFILE\.ssh\id_rsa_github -C "ssh key for github"
```

After running the command, you will be prompted to enter a strong passphrase. Type your passphrase, press **Enter**, then confirm it when prompted to enhance security.

### Step 3: Add Your SSH Key to the SSH Agent

Start the SSH agent by running the following command in **PowerShell**:

```powershell
Start-Service ssh-agent
```

Then add your key:

```powershell
ssh-add $env:USERPROFILE\.ssh\id_ed25519_github
```

If you used RSA, replace `id_ed25519_github` with `id_rsa_github`.

### Step 4: Persist SSH Key Across Sessions

To ensure your SSH key is always loaded when you open a new PowerShell session, you need to configure the SSH settings.

#### **Configure SSH to Automatically Add the Key**

Edit (or create) your SSH config file:

```powershell
notepad $env:USERPROFILE\.ssh\config
```

Add the following lines:

```powershell
Host github.com
  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_ed25519_github
  AddKeysToAgent yes
```

This ensures that your SSH key is automatically loaded by the SSH agent when needed.

#### **Alternative: Load the SSH Key in PowerShell Profile**

If you want to explicitly load the SSH key every time a new PowerShell session starts, add the following command to your PowerShell profile:

```powershell
notepad $PROFILE
```

Add this line:

```powershell
Start-Service ssh-agent; ssh-add $env:USERPROFILE\.ssh\id_ed25519_github
```

Save the file and restart PowerShell.

### Step 5: Add the SSH Key to Your GitHub Account

```powershell
type $env:USERPROFILE\.ssh\id_ed25519_github.pub
```

If you used RSA, replace `id_ed25519_github.pub` with `id_rsa_github.pub`.

Now, go to **GitHub > Settings > SSH and GPG Keys** and click **New SSH Key**. Paste the copied key and save it.

### Step 6: Test the SSH Connection

Verify that your SSH key is correctly added by running:

```powershell
ssh -T git@github.com
```

If prompted with:

```plaintext
This key is not known by any other names.
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no/[fingerprint])?
```

Type **yes** to proceed.

You should see a message like:

```plaintext
Hi username! You've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not provide shell access.
```

### Step 7: Configure Git to Use SSH (Optional)

If you're still using HTTPS for Git operations, switch to SSH:

```powershell
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:username/repository.git
```

### Conclusion

You've successfully configured SSH authentication for GitHub on Windows! This setup allows you to securely connect to your repositories without entering your password repeatedly. Happy coding!
