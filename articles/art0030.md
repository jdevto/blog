### Understanding GitHub Actions Working Directory

GitHub Actions provides a powerful platform for automating workflows directly within your GitHub repository. A key part of understanding how workflows operate is knowing where files are stored during execution. In this article, we'll explore the default working directory, where action files are downloaded, and how you can manage these paths effectively.

---

## Default Working Directory

Path

```bash
/home/runner/work/<repository-name>/<repository-name>
```

Example Structure

```bash
/home/runner/work/
├── my-project
│   └── my-project (repository files go here)
```

---

## Setting Working Directory

You can set the `working-directory` at different levels in your workflow file. Here’s how:

### Workflow Level

Define the `default-working-directory` for the entire workflow in the `defaults` section:

```yaml
defaults:
  run:
    working-directory: ./global-scripts
```

**Effect:** All `run` commands in the workflow will execute from the `./global-scripts` directory unless overridden.

### Job Level

Set the `working-directory` for all steps within a specific job:

```yaml
jobs:
  example-job:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    defaults:
      run:
        working-directory: ./job-scripts
    steps:
      - name: Run job-level script
        run: ./script.sh
```

**Effect:** All `run` commands in the `example-job` will execute from the `./job-scripts` directory.

### Step Level

Set the `working-directory` for an individual step:

```yaml
steps:
  - name: Run step-level script
    run: ./script.sh
    working-directory: ./step-scripts
```

**Effect:** Only this specific step will execute from the `./step-scripts` directory.

## Environment Variables Related to Paths

GitHub Actions runners expose several environment variables that you can use to dynamically reference paths during workflows. These include:

| Variable               | Description                                                                               |
|------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `GITHUB_WORKSPACE`     | The default working directory of the repository. Equivalent to `/home/runner/work/<repo>/<repo>`. |
| `RUNNER_TEMP`          | Path to a directory for temporary files. Equivalent to `/home/runner/work/_temp`.         |
| `RUNNER_TOOL_CACHE`    | Directory for cached tools and dependencies. Equivalent to `/opt/hostedtoolcache`.        |
| `GITHUB_ACTION_PATH`   | Path to the action's files when using a custom or third-party action.                     |
| `GITHUB_ENV`           | File path for exporting environment variables for subsequent steps.                       |
| `GITHUB_PATH`          | File path for appending to the system `PATH` for subsequent steps.                        |
| `GITHUB_REF`           | The full reference (branch or tag) that triggered the workflow.                          |

### Example Usage

#### Accessing a Tag Dynamically

If your workflow is triggered by a tag, you can extract the tag name from `GITHUB_REF`:

```yaml
steps:
  - name: Extract Tag Name
    run: echo "Tag: ${GITHUB_REF#refs/tags/}"
```

You can use this dynamic value to construct paths:

```yaml
steps:
  - name: Run with Dynamic Tag Path
    run: echo "Using path /home/runner/work/_actions/my-actions/my-actions/v1/"
```

#### Referencing the Repository Workspace

```yaml
steps:
  - name: Use Workspace
    run: ls $GITHUB_WORKSPACE
```

#### Storing Temporary Files

```yaml
steps:
  - name: Create Temp File
    run: echo "Temporary data" > $RUNNER_TEMP/temp.txt
```

#### Using Cached Tools

```yaml
steps:
  - name: Check Tool Cache
    run: ls $RUNNER_TOOL_CACHE
```

---

## Where Do Action Files Go?

Path

```bash
/home/runner/work/_actions
```

Example Structure

For the action `actions/checkout@v4`:

```bash
/home/runner/work/_actions/
├── actions
│   └── checkout
│       └── v4 (action files)
```

### Accessing Custom Files

If you have a custom file `hello-world.py` included in a custom action `my-actions/my-actions@v1`:

```bash
/home/runner/work/_actions/
├── my-actions
│   └── my-actions
│       └── v1
│           └── hello-world.py
```

#### Example Workflow Step

```yaml
steps:
  - name: Run custom Python script
    run: python /home/runner/work/_actions/my-actions/my-actions/v1/hello-world.py
```

---

## Temporary and Cache Directories

### Temporary Directory

```bash
/home/runner/work/_temp
```

### Example 1 Structure

```bash
/home/runner/work/
├── _temp
    └── (temporary files)
```

### Tool Cache Directory

```bash
/opt/hostedtoolcache
```

### Example 2 Structure

```bash
/opt/hostedtoolcache/
├── (cached tools and dependencies)
```

---

## Cleaning Up Directories

All files and directories created during a workflow run are ephemeral and automatically cleaned up on GitHub-hosted runners. For self-hosted runners, you may need to manage cleanup manually to avoid storage issues.

---

## Summary of Key Paths

| Path                              | Purpose                                  |
| --------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| `/home/runner/work/<repo>/<repo>` | Default working directory for workflows. |
| `/home/runner/work/_actions`      | Directory for downloaded action files.   |
| `/home/runner/work/_temp`         | Temporary file storage for workflows.    |
| `/opt/hostedtoolcache`            | Tool cache for reusable dependencies.    |

---

## Best Practices

1. **Use `working-directory` Option:** Set the `working-directory` explicitly for custom workflows.
2. **Avoid Hardcoding Paths:** Use environment variables like `GITHUB_WORKSPACE` and `RUNNER_TEMP` for compatibility.
3. **Extract Tags Dynamically:** Use `GITHUB_REF` to dynamically determine tags and construct paths.
4. **Clean Up for Self-Hosted Runners:** Implement cleanup scripts to manage storage effectively.

By understanding the directory structure of GitHub Actions runners, you can design workflows that are more efficient, portable, and easier to debug. Happy automating!
