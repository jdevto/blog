Sometimes I just want to run an ECS task **on demand**, not wait for EventBridge or a service.
This is how I do it for **classic EC2-based ECS clusters** (not Fargate).

---

## 🧠 When to use this

* For **ad-hoc maintenance jobs** (like log cleanup or data processing)
* To **manually trigger** an ECS task that’s normally run by EventBridge
* When testing a new task definition before automating it

---

## ⚙️ Prerequisites

* ECS cluster already exists and is **EC2-based**
* A task definition (family or ARN)
* IAM permissions to run ECS tasks

Check the cluster type:

```bash
aws ecs describe-clusters --clusters cluster1
```

---

## 🚀 Run the task manually

Minimal command:

```bash
aws ecs run-task \
  --cluster cluster1 \
  --task-definition arn:aws:ecs:ap-southeast-2:111122223333:task-definition/my-task:134 \
  --count 1 \
  --launch-type EC2 \
  --region ap-southeast-2
```

That immediately starts the task on one of your ECS container instances.

---

## 🧩 Check task status

List recent tasks:

```bash
aws ecs list-tasks --cluster cluster1
```

Describe a task:

```bash
aws ecs describe-tasks --cluster cluster1 --tasks <task-id>
```

Stop a running task:

```bash
aws ecs stop-task --cluster cluster1 --task <task-id>
```

---

## 📝 Notes

* `--launch-type EC2` ensures it runs on existing container instances
* `--enable-execute-command` allows you to connect using `aws ecs execute-command`
* No network configuration is required for EC2 launch type
* Task permissions and env vars come from the **task definition**

---

## ✅ Summary

Quick reminder for myself:

* Use `aws ecs run-task` for manual ECS jobs
* Works well for debugging, testing, or one-off operations
* Keep it simple — no EventBridge required
