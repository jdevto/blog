## Introduction

Running a **Windows 10 VM** in Unraid provides a full Windows environment for development, gaming, or server applications. This guide walks you through the process of setting up a Windows 10 VM using Unraidâ€™s virtualization tools.

## Steps

### 1. Enable Virtualization in Unraid

- Log in to **Unraid Web UI** (`http://your-unraid-ip`).
- Navigate to **Settings > VM Manager**.
- Set **Enable VMs** to `Yes` and click **Apply**.

### 2. Upload Windows 10 and VirtIO ISOs to Unraid

- Go to **Shares** > Open the `isos` share.
- Upload the **Windows 10 ISO** (`Win10-XX.iso`).
- Download the latest **VirtIO drivers ISO** from [Fedoraâ€™s official website](https://fedorapeople.org/groups/virt/virtio-win/direct-downloads/stable-virtio/) and upload it to the `isos` share.

### 3. Create a New Windows 10 VM

- Go to **VMs** > Click **Add VM** > Select **Windows 10**.
- Configure VM settings:
  - **Autostart**: Enable to start the VM automatically on boot.
  - **Name**: `Windows10-VM`
  - **CPU Cores**: At least 2 cores.
  - **Memory**: At least 4GB (4096MB).
  - **BIOS Type**: `OVMF` for UEFI or `SeaBIOS` for legacy boot.
  - **Install ISO**: Select the uploaded Windows 10 ISO.
  - **Primary vDisk Size**: At least 40GB.
  - **vDisk Bus**: `VirtIO` for best performance.
  - **Graphics Card**: `VNC` unless using GPU passthrough.
  - **CD-ROM Device (VirtIO Drivers)**: Select the VirtIO drivers ISO from the `isos` share.
- Click **Create**.

### 4. Load VirtIO Drivers During Windows Installation

- When prompted for a disk during Windows installation, select **Load Driver**, navigate to the **VirtIO drivers ISO**, and install the necessary drivers.
- **Storage Drivers**: Go to `viostor > w10 > amd64` and select the driver to allow Windows to detect the virtual disk.
- **Network Drivers**: Go to `NetKVM > w10 > amd64` and install the driver to enable network connectivity.
- **Balloon Drivers**: Go to `Balloon > w10 > amd64` and install to optimize memory management.

### 5. Complete Windows Installation and Enable RDP

- Continue with the Windows installation process.
- After installation is complete, ensure the VirtIO drivers ISO is still mounted.
- Open **File Explorer** inside the VM and verify all drivers were properly installed.
- Restart the VM to ensure all changes take effect.
- Enable **Remote Desktop** access:
  - Open **Settings > System > Remote Desktop**.
  - Toggle **Enable Remote Desktop** to `On`.
  - Allow connections from devices running any version of Remote Desktop.
  - Note the VMâ€™s IP address for remote access.

- Continue with the Windows installation process.
- After installation is complete, ensure the VirtIO drivers ISO is still mounted.
- Open **File Explorer** inside the VM and verify all drivers were properly installed.
- Restart the VM to ensure all changes take effect.

### 6. Manage the VM

- **Start/Stop**: Use the **VMs** tab in Unraid.
- **Adjust CPU/RAM**: Edit VM settings as needed.
- **Access via RDP**:

  ```powershell
  mstsc /v:vm-ip
  ```

### Troubleshooting

- **Windows doesn't detect the storage drive during installation**: Ensure the VirtIO drivers ISO is mounted and manually load the storage driver.
- **Network issues inside the VM**: Install the VirtIO network drivers from the VirtIO drivers ISO.
- **Performance issues**: Enable VirtIO for disk and network, allocate sufficient RAM and CPU cores, and ensure ballooning is properly configured.
- **GPU passthrough problems**: Check if the GPU supports passthrough and ensure it's not bound to Unraid.

## Conclusion

You have successfully created a **Windows 10 VM** in Unraid for testing, development, or gaming. ðŸš€
