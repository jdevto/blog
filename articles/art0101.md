## Install Node.js on Windows via CLI (winget)

Setting up Node.js on Windows no longer requires clicking through installers — thanks to **winget**, Microsoft’s official Windows Package Manager.

Here’s how you can install Node.js with npm in seconds, entirely from the terminal.

---

## 1. Open PowerShell

Press **Win + X** → select **Windows PowerShell (Admin)** or **Terminal (Admin)**.

---

## 2. Find Available Node.js Versions

First, list all available Node.js packages:

```powershell
winget search OpenJS.NodeJS
```

You'll see results like:

```plaintext
Name          Id                Version
-----------------------------------------------
Node.js       OpenJS.NodeJS     25.1.0
Node.js 14    OpenJS.NodeJS.14  14.18.1
Node.js 16    OpenJS.NodeJS.16  16.20.2
Node.js 18    OpenJS.NodeJS.18  18.20.8
Node.js 20    OpenJS.NodeJS.20  20.19.5
Node.js 21    OpenJS.NodeJS.21  21.7.2
Node.js 22    OpenJS.NodeJS.22  22.21.0
Node.js 23    OpenJS.NodeJS.23  23.11.0
Node.js (LTS) OpenJS.NodeJS.LTS 24.11.0
```

Pick the LTS version (recommended) or the latest version and install it:

```powershell
winget install -e --id OpenJS.NodeJS.LTS
```

Or install the latest version:

```powershell
winget install -e --id OpenJS.NodeJS
```

> ⚠️ The LTS (Long Term Support) version is recommended for most users — it's more stable and receives security updates longer.

## 3. Reopen Your CLI (Important!)

After installation, **close and reopen PowerShell or Terminal**. This refreshes the PATH so that `node` and `npm` are recognized.

Then verify the installation:

```powershell
node --version
npm --version
```

You should see version numbers for both Node.js and npm (npm comes bundled with Node.js).

---

## 4. Troubleshooting: npm Not Recognized in PowerShell

If you see an error like `npm : File C:\Program Files\nodejs\npm.ps1 cannot be loaded because running scripts is disabled on this system`, PowerShell's execution policy is blocking npm scripts.

Here are three ways to fix it:

### Option A: Change Execution Policy (Recommended)

Run PowerShell as Administrator and set the execution policy:

```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
```

Then close and reopen PowerShell. This allows local scripts (like npm) to run while still protecting against unsigned remote scripts.

### Option B: Use Command Prompt Instead

If you prefer not to change PowerShell settings, use **Command Prompt (cmd)** or **Windows Terminal** with the Command Prompt profile instead. npm works without any policy changes in cmd.

### Option C: Bypass for Current Session

Temporarily bypass the policy for the current PowerShell session:

```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process
```

This only affects the current session and resets when you close PowerShell.

---

## 5. (Optional) Upgrade npm

Keep `npm` up to date:

```powershell
npm install -g npm@latest
```

---

## Why Use winget?

✅ Official (maintained by Microsoft + OpenJS Foundation)

✅ Adds Node.js and npm to PATH automatically (just reopen your terminal to apply)

✅ Fully scriptable (great for automation & CI)

✅ Reproducible setup for fresh machines

---

That's it — you've installed Node.js and npm on Windows **with a single command**, and it's ready to use after reopening your terminal.
