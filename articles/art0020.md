## How to Configure GitHub Authentication Using SSH Certificates

Using SSH certificates to authenticate with GitHub is a secure and efficient way to manage your repositories. This guide will walk you through the process step by step.

---

### 1. Generate an SSH Key Pair

First, create a new SSH key pair or use an existing one.

Run the following command:

```bash
ssh-keygen -o -a 100 -t ed25519 -f ~/.ssh/id_ed25519_github -C "ssh key for github"
```

- `-o`: Ensures the private key file is saved in the new OpenSSH format for improved security.
- `-a 100`: Specifies the number of rounds for the key derivation function, enhancing brute-force resistance.
- Enter a passphrase (optional but recommended for added security).

---

### 2. Add the SSH Key to Your SSH Agent

Next, ensure your SSH key is available to the SSH agent.

Start the SSH agent:

```bash
eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
```

Add your private key:

```bash
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519_github
```

---

### 3. Persist SSH Key Across Sessions

To ensure your SSH key is always loaded when you open a new terminal session, there are two main methods. The **recommended method** is to configure your SSH settings, while the alternative is to modify your `.bashrc` file.

#### **Recommended: Configure SSH to Automatically Add the Key**

Edit (or create) your SSH config file:

```bash
nano ~/.ssh/config
```

Add the following lines:

```bash
Host github.com
  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_ed25519_github
  AddKeysToAgent yes
```

This ensures that your SSH key is automatically loaded by the SSH agent when needed.

#### **Alternative: Load the SSH Key in `.bashrc`**

If you want to explicitly load the SSH key every time a new terminal session starts, add the following command to your `~/.bashrc` (or `~/.bash_profile` on macOS):

```bash
echo 'eval "$(ssh-agent -s)" && ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519_github' >> ~/.bashrc
```

Then reload your shell configuration:

```bash
source ~/.bashrc
```

This ensures the SSH agent starts automatically and the key is added every time you open a new terminal session.

### 4. Add the Public Key to Your GitHub Account

Now, link your public SSH key to your GitHub account:

1. Copy the contents of your public key:

   ```bash
   cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519_github.pub
   ```

   **Note:** Ensure that you only share the public key file (e.g., `id_ed25519_github.pub`) and never share your private key file (e.g., `id_ed25519_github`).

2. Add the key to GitHub:
   - Open [GitHub SSH Settings](https://github.com/settings/keys).
   - Click **New SSH key**.
   - Paste your public key into the key field.
   - Give it a descriptive title and save it.

### 5. Configure SSH for GitHub

To ensure GitHub uses the correct SSH key, configure your SSH settings:

Edit (or create) the `~/.ssh/config` file:

```bash
nano ~/.ssh/config
```

Add the following configuration:

```bash
Host github.com
  HostName github.com
  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_ed25519_github
  IdentitiesOnly yes
```

**Note:** This ensures that only the specified identity file is used, which is crucial in environments with multiple SSH keys to avoid authentication errors.

Save and exit the file.

---

### 6. Test Your SSH Connection

Verify that GitHub recognizes your SSH setup by running:

```bash
ssh -T git@github.com
```

If everything is set up correctly, you should see a success message:

```bash
Hi username! You've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not provide shell access.
```

**Note:** If this step fails, ensure the following:

- Verify that the SSH key has the correct permissions by running `chmod 600 ~/.ssh/id_ed25519_github`.
- Confirm that the public key is added to your GitHub account.
- Check that the `~/.ssh/config` file is properly configured.

---

### 7. Use SSH for GitHub Repositories

Finally, use SSH URLs for GitHub repositories:

- Clone a repository using SSH:

  ```bash
  git clone git@github.com:username/repository.git
  ```

- Update an existing repository's remote URL to use SSH:

  ```bash
  git remote set-url origin git@github.com:username/repository.git
  ```

  **Tip:** To confirm that the remote URL has been updated successfully, run:

  ```bash
  git remote -v
  ```

### Conclusion

With this setup, you've configured GitHub to authenticate using SSH certificates and ensured that your private key is always loaded in new terminal sessions. This provides a secure and efficient method for managing your repositories. Let me know in the comments if you have any questions or tips to share!
