## 🚀 Overview

AWS provides multiple options for secure, keyless remote access to EC2 instances without requiring SSH keys, public IPs, or bastion hosts. The three main solutions are:

1. **AWS Systems Manager Session Manager (SSM Session Manager)**
2. **EC2 Instance Connect**
3. **EC2 Instance Connect Endpoint**

Each method has distinct advantages, limitations, and use cases. This guide compares them to help you choose the best option for your needs.

## 🛠 AWS Systems Manager Session Manager

Key Benefits

- **No Public IPs Required** - Works with instances inside private subnets.
- **No SSH Key Management** - Uses IAM-based authentication.
- **Session Logging & Auditing** - Logs user activity in CloudTrail.
- **AWS Console & CLI Integration** - Accessible via AWS Console or CLI.
- **Supports VPC Endpoints** - No need for outbound internet access when using PrivateLink.

How It Works

1. Attach an **IAM Role with `AmazonSSMManagedInstanceCore` policy** to the instance.
2. Ensure the instance has **SSM Agent installed and running**.
3. Use `aws ssm start-session` or AWS Console to connect.
4. AWS handles authentication and communication securely.

## 🛠 EC2 Instance Connect

Key Benefits

- **No SSH Keys Required** - AWS injects temporary keys for authentication.
- **Simple to Use** - Directly accessible from the AWS Console.
- **Ideal for Public Instances** - Works with EC2 instances that have public IPs.

How It Works

1. Select the EC2 instance in the AWS Console.
2. Click **Connect > EC2 Instance Connect**.
3. AWS injects a temporary SSH key and logs you in.

Limitations

- **Requires Public IP** - Cannot connect to instances in private subnets.
- **No CLI Support for Private Instances** - CLI access only works for instances with public IPs.

## 🛠 EC2 Instance Connect Endpoint

Key Benefits

- **Works with Private Subnets** - Enables SSH access without requiring a public IP.
- **IAM-Based Access Control** - Uses temporary SSH keys.
- **No Bastion Hosts Needed** - Connects to instances inside a private VPC securely.
- **Works with AWS CLI & Console** - Provides a seamless connection experience.

How It Works

1. Deploy an **EC2 Instance Connect Endpoint** in the same subnet as the target instance.
2. Assign a **Security Group** to control access.
3. Ensure the instance has **EC2 Instance Connect Agent installed and running**.
4. Use the AWS Console or CLI to initiate a session.
