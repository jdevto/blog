## 🌐 Host Static Websites with GCS

Google Cloud Storage (GCS) makes it easy to host static websites without managing web servers. You can start with a **simple public bucket** to serve files directly, or **enhance it with a global load balancer** to unlock features like CDN, clean URLs, and custom error pages.

## 📺 Architecture Overview

!["Static Site Hosting Options"](https://github.com/jdevto/blog/raw/main/images/gcs-website.png)

This diagram shows two ways to serve static files from a **public GCS bucket**:

---

### ➔ Direct GCS Hosting

* Serves files via `https://storage.googleapis.com/your-bucket/...`
* Quick and simple
* Ideal for testing or budget-conscious deployments

---

### ➔ Load Balancer Extension

* Adds Cloud CDN, Load Balancer, and Static IP
* Enables clean root domain, custom error pages, and faster global delivery
* Best for production setups

You can **start with Direct GCS**, and later **extend via Load Balancer** without changing your storage setup.

## 🧱 Hosting Comparison

| Feature      | Direct GCS              | Load Balancer Extension     |
| ------------ | ----------------------- | --------------------------- |
| Root Access  | Returns XML listing     | ✅ Serves index.html cleanly |
| Error Pages  | Default GCS XML error   | ✅ Custom 404.html supported |
| CDN Support  | ❌ Not available         | ✅ Cloud CDN enabled         |
| Static IP    | ❌ Not available         | ✅ Global IP address         |
| Setup Effort | ✅ Very easy             | ⚠️ Requires network setup   |
| Monthly Cost | 💚 \~\$0.03 (free tier) | 💰 \~\$20+                  |

```plaintext
[ index.html ] — accessible directly
[ 404.html ] — not automatically served on error
```

## 🚀 Why Extend with Load Balancer?

* Clean root domain (`https://yourdomain.com/`)
* SEO-friendly behavior
* Faster global delivery via CDN

## 💡 Recommendation Guide

| Scenario               | Suggested Setup |
| ---------------------- | --------------- |
| Learning / Testing     | Direct GCS      |
| Production Website     | Load Balancer   |
| Budget-Conscious       | Direct GCS      |
