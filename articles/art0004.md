## Building a Simple Cloud-Native App with Docker

In this demo, we'll create a basic cloud-native application using Docker. This app will run in a container, and weâ€™ll explore how Docker enables cloud-native principles such as portability and isolation.

### Step 1: Create a Simple Node.js Microservice

- First, create a `server.js` file:

  ```javascript
  const express = require('express');
  const app = express();
  const port = process.env.PORT || 3000;

  app.get('/', (req, res) => {
    res.send('Hello from Docker Cloud-Native App!');
  });

  app.listen(port, () => {
    console.log(`Server running on port ${port}`);
  });
  ```

- Install dependencies:

  ```bash
  npm init -y
  npm install express
  ```

### Step 2: Dockerize the Application

- Create a Dockerfile to define the container:

  ```dockerfile
  # Use official Node.js image from Docker Hub
  FROM node:20

  # Set working directory inside the container
  WORKDIR /app

  # Copy package.json and install dependencies
  COPY package*.json ./
  RUN npm install

  # Copy the rest of the app's source code
  COPY . .

  # Expose the port the app will run on
  EXPOSE 3000

  # Command to run the app
  CMD ["node", "server.js"]
  ```

### Step 3: Build and Run the Docker Container

- Build the Docker image:

  ```bash
  docker build -t cloud-native-app .
  ```

- Run the container:

  ```bash
  docker run -p 3000:3000 cloud-native-app
  ```

### Step 4: Access the Application

- Open your browser and visit `http://localhost:3000`. You should see:

  ```bash
  Hello from Docker Cloud-Native App!
  ```

## Conclusion

You've successfully built and run a simple cloud-native application using Docker. This app is now isolated in a container, and you can easily move or scale it across different environments without worrying about dependencies.
