It’s lightweight, easy to use, and seamlessly integrates with Visual Studio Code, saving you time when you need to share links to specific lines or files in your GitHub repository.

### Install the Extension

Follow these steps:

1. Open VS Code.

### Copy GitHub Permalinks

Here’s how to copy GitHub permalinks for files in your repository:

1. Open a file that is tracked in your GitHub repository.
2. Right-click inside the file and select one of the following options:
    - **Copy GitHub Permalink**: This generates a permalink for the selected line(s) in the file.
    - **Copy GitHub Permalink (HEAD)**: This generates a link using the latest commit (HEAD) for the file.

Now, you can paste the generated link wherever you need it—whether in a pull request, issue, or message to colleagues.

### Keyboard Shortcuts for Faster Workflow

Assigning custom keyboard shortcuts:

1. Open the Command Palette by pressing Ctrl+Shift+P (or Cmd+Shift+P on macOS).
2. Search for Keyboard Shortcuts and open the editor.
3. Find **Copy GitHub Permalink** and **Copy GitHub Permalink (HEAD)** in the list.
