## Configuring AWS Vault for Secure Credential Management on Linux

Managing AWS credentials securely is critical for developers and engineers. AWS Vault is a fantastic tool that enhances credential security by securely storing and accessing AWS credentials. Here's how to set up AWS Vault on a Linux system.

> **Note:** I have not found a solution for a keychain backend setup. This guide focuses on using the file backend.

### Why AWS Vault?

AWS Vault helps:

- Store credentials securely in an encrypted file.
- Avoid hardcoding or saving plain text AWS credentials.
- Use temporary session tokens to interact with AWS services.

---

### Step 1: Install AWS CLI

Before installing AWS Vault, ensure the AWS CLI is set up on your system:

1. **Download the installation script**:

   ```bash
   curl "https://awscli.amazonaws.com/awscli-exe-linux-x86_64.zip" -o "awscliv2.zip"
   ```

2. **Ensure `unzip` is installed**:
   - For Ubuntu/Debian:

     ```bash
     sudo apt update && sudo apt install unzip -y
     ```

   - For Fedora/RHEL:

     ```bash
     sudo dnf install unzip -y
     ```

3. **Extract the ZIP file**:

   ```bash
   unzip awscliv2.zip
   ```

4. **Run the installer**:

   ```bash
   sudo ./aws/install
   ```

5. **Verify the installation**:

   ```bash
   aws --version
   ```

   The output should display the installed version of AWS CLI.

6. **Clean up temporary files**:

   ```bash
   rm awscliv2.zip
   rm -r aws/
   ```

### Step 2: Install AWS Vault

Install AWS Vault on Linux:

1. **Download AWS Vault binary**:

   ```bash
   sudo curl -L -o /usr/local/bin/aws-vault https://github.com/99designs/aws-vault/releases/latest/download/aws-vault-linux-amd64
   ```

2. **Set executable permissions**:

   ```bash
   sudo chmod 755 /usr/local/bin/aws-vault
   ```

3. **Verify installation**:

   ```bash
   aws-vault --version
   ```

### Step 3: Configure AWS Vault

AWS Vault works with your AWS CLI configuration. Ensure you have the `~/.aws/config` and `~/.aws/credentials` files set up.

#### Use File Backend

Configure AWS Vault to use the file backend by setting the `AWS_VAULT_BACKEND` environment variable:

```bash
export AWS_VAULT_BACKEND=file
```

#### Add a Profile

Add your AWS credentials to AWS Vault using the `add` command:

```bash
aws-vault add <profile-name>
```

This will prompt you to enter your AWS Access Key and Secret Key. The credentials will be securely stored in an encrypted file.

Next, configure the default AWS region for the profile using the AWS CLI:

```bash
aws configure set region <your-region> --profile <profile-name>
```

Replace `<your-region>` with the desired AWS region (e.g., `ap-southeast-2`) and `<profile-name>` with the profile name you added in `aws-vault`.

#### Optional Steps

You can also configure additional settings for your profile:

- Set the MFA serial:

  ```bash
  aws configure set mfa_serial arn:aws:iam::<account-id>:mfa/<username> --profile <profile-name>
  ```

- Set the role arn:

  ```bash
  aws configure set role_arn arn:aws:iam::<account-id>:role/<role-name> --profile <profile-name>
  ```

  Replace `<account-id>` with your AWS account ID (e.g., 123456789012), `<role-name>` with the name of the IAM role you want to assume, and `<profile-name>` with the profile name you added in aws-vault.

- Set a role session name for better traceability:

  ```bash
  aws configure set role_session_name <session-name> --profile <profile-name>
  ```

  **Purpose:** The `role_session_name` provides a unique identifier for your session when assuming a role. It appears in AWS CloudTrail logs, making it easier to trace actions performed during the session.

  **Best Practices:**
  - Use a descriptive name that reflects the purpose of the session, such as `dev-session` or `test-session`.
  - Ensure session names are unique to avoid confusion when tracking activities in logs.

---

### Step 4: Test Your Setup

Test the configuration by running an AWS CLI command:

```bash
aws-vault exec <profile-name> -- aws sts get-caller-identity
```

This should return details of your AWS account, confirming that AWS Vault is correctly configured.

## Conclusion

AWS Vault is an excellent tool for improving the security of AWS credential management. By storing credentials in an encrypted file, you can reduce the risks associated with plain-text storage.
