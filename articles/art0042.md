## **Configure SSH Login from Windows to Windows**

Setting up SSH login allows you to securely connect between two Windows machines. This is useful for remote management, automation, and scripting tasks.

### **Step 1: Verify User Requirements on the Destination Machine**

Before proceeding with SSH setup, ensure the following requirements are met for the user account that will be accessed remotely:

1. **The user must exist on the destination machine**
   - Use `username@hostname` or `hostname\username` for local accounts.
   - Use `DOMAIN\username` if logging into a domain-joined machine.

2. **The user must have a password**
   - Windows OpenSSH does **not allow empty passwords** by default.

3. **The user must have SSH access**
   - Check if they are **not blocked** in `C:\ProgramData\ssh\sshd_config`.
   - Ensure `AllowUsers` (if used) includes the username.

4. **The user must have remote login rights**
   - In **Local Security Policy** (`secpol.msc`), check:
     - **Allow log on through Remote Desktop Services**
     - **Deny log on locally** (must **not** include the user).

5. **Ensure the user has a valid home directory**
   - The profile should exist under `C:\Users\username`.

6. **If non-admin, grant SSH access**
   - If restricted, run:

     ```cmd
     icacls C:\ProgramData\ssh\sshd_config /grant Users:RX
     ```

### **Step 2: Install OpenSSH**

#### **On the Destination Machine (SSH Server):**

1. Open **PowerShell** with administrative privileges:

   - Press **Win + S**, type `PowerShell`, right-click on **Windows PowerShell**, and select **Run as Administrator**.

2. Check if OpenSSH Server is installed:

   ```powershell
   Get-WindowsCapability -Online | Where-Object Name -like '*OpenSSH.Server*'
   ```

   If it shows `State : NotPresent`, install OpenSSH Server:

   ```powershell
   Add-WindowsCapability -Online -Name OpenSSH.Server~~~~0.0.1.0
   ```

3. Start and enable the SSH service:

   ```powershell
   Start-Service sshd
   Set-Service -Name sshd -StartupType Automatic
   ```

4. Allow SSH through Windows Firewall:

   ```powershell
   New-NetFirewallRule -Name "OpenSSH" -DisplayName "OpenSSH Server" -Enabled True -Direction Inbound -Protocol TCP -Action Allow -LocalPort 22
   ```

#### **On the Source Machine (SSH Client):**

1. Check if OpenSSH Client is installed:

   ```powershell
   Get-WindowsCapability -Online | Where-Object Name -like '*OpenSSH.Client*'
   ```

   If it shows `State : NotPresent`, install OpenSSH Client:

   ```powershell
   Add-WindowsCapability -Online -Name OpenSSH.Client~~~~0.0.1.0
   ```

---

### **Step 3: Start an SSH Session Between Windows Machines**

1. On the **source machine**, open **PowerShell** or **Command Prompt**.
2. Connect to the destination machine:

   ```powershell
   ssh username@destination-ip
   ```

3. If prompted, enter the password for the destination machine.

---

### **Step 4: Verify SSH Connection**

1. Once connected, run a simple command to verify access:

   ```powershell
   whoami
   ```

   This should return the username of the logged-in session.
2. If you need to transfer files using SCP, use:

   ```powershell
   scp C:\path\to\file.txt username@destination-ip:C:\destination\path\
   ```

---

### **Troubleshooting (Use Command Prompt for These Steps)**

If SSH fails to connect:

1. Restart the SSH service on the destination machine:

   ```cmd
   net stop sshd && net start sshd
   ```

2. Ensure SSH is listening on port 22:

   ```cmd
   netstat -an | findstr :22
   ```

   If the port is not open, restart the SSH service and check firewall settings.
3. If SSHD fails to start, check logs:

   ```cmd
   wevtutil qe Application /q:"*[System[Provider[@Name='sshd']]]" /c:10 /rd:true /f:text
   ```

   Look for errors related to missing keys or incorrect permissions.
4. Ensure SSH host keys exist:

   ```cmd
   cd C:\ProgramData\ssh
   ssh-keygen -A
   net stop sshd && net start sshd
   ```

Setting up **SSH login from Windows to Windows** enables secure remote access. This setup is useful for remote management, automation, and system administration.
