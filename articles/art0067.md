## ðŸš€ Top 20 Most Useful `kubectl` Commands for Everyday Kubernetes Workflows

Whether you're a developer, SRE, DevOps engineer, or just starting out with Kubernetes, mastering `kubectl` is essential. Hereâ€™s a curated list of the top 20 `kubectl` commands that are universally useful across teams and cloud platforms (EKS, GKE, AKS, etc.). These commands will save you time, reduce confusion, and help you debug faster.

---

## ðŸ”Ÿ Most Commonly Used `kubectl` Commands

### 1. **Get all pods across namespaces**

```bash
kubectl get pods -A
```

Great for seeing whatâ€™s running cluster-wide and spotting stuck or crashing pods.

---

### 2. **Describe a pod (deep debugging)**

```bash
kubectl describe pod <pod-name> -n <namespace>
```

Reveals node assignment, events, taints, failed mounts, and more.

---

### 3. **View logs from a pod**

```bash
kubectl logs <pod-name> -n <namespace>
```

Use `--previous` if the pod has crashed and restarted.

---

### 4. **Exec into a running container**

```bash
kubectl exec -it <pod-name> -n <namespace> -- /bin/sh
```

Great for real-time inspection, testing configs, or quick troubleshooting.

---

### 5. **View recent events (cluster-wide)**

```bash
kubectl get events -A --sort-by='.lastTimestamp'
```

Use this to see the latest cluster activity, scheduling failures, crashes, and warnings.

---

### 6. **View resource usage per pod**

```bash
kubectl top pods -A
```

Requires Metrics Server installed. Useful for performance monitoring.

---

### 7. **Get all services across namespaces**

```bash
kubectl get svc -A
```

Quickly see which services are exposed and their types (ClusterIP, LoadBalancer, etc).

---

### 8. **Restart a deployment**

```bash
kubectl rollout restart deployment <name> -n <namespace>
```

Triggers a rolling restartâ€”useful after changing ConfigMaps, Secrets, or images.

---

### 9. **Port forward to a service or pod**

```bash
kubectl port-forward svc/<svc-name> 8080:80 -n <namespace>
```

Perfect for accessing internal services locally.

---

### 10. **Get everything in a namespace**

```bash
kubectl get all -n <namespace>
```

One-liner to view pods, deployments, services, etc., all at once.

---

## ðŸ”Ÿ More Essential `kubectl` Commands

### 11. **Check node info**

```bash
kubectl get nodes -o wide
```

Displays node capacity, labels, roles, and IPs.

---

### 12. **List namespaces with labels**

```bash
kubectl get namespaces --show-labels
```

Helps with namespace-level Fargate profiles and label selectors.

---

### 13. **Get custom resources (CRDs)**

```bash
kubectl get crds
```

Essential when working with operators, controllers, or observability tooling.

---

### 14. **Copy files into/from a pod**

```bash
kubectl cp ./local-file.txt <pod-name>:/tmp/ -n <namespace>
```

Use this for backups, config injection, or pulling logs/artifacts out.

---

### 15. **Apply a manifest**

```bash
kubectl apply -f your-file.yaml
```

Declarative way to manage resources.

---

### 16. **Delete a resource**

```bash
kubectl delete deployment <name> -n <namespace>
```

Useful for clearing broken resources blocking Terraform or Helm.

---

### 17. **Watch pod status live**

```bash
kubectl get pods -n <namespace> -w
```

Great for seeing rollout or crash cycles in real time.

---

### 18. **Label a resource**

```bash
kubectl label pod <pod-name> env=staging -n <namespace>
```

Labels are powerful for selectors, policies, and organizing workloads.

---

### 19. **Taint a node**

```bash
kubectl taint nodes <node-name> key=value:NoSchedule
```

Advanced scheduling controlâ€”combine with pod tolerations.

---

### 20. **Explain a Kubernetes resource**

```bash
kubectl explain deployment.spec.template.spec.containers
```

Learn the structure of complex manifests right from the CLI.

---

## âœ… Wrap-up

Mastering these 20 `kubectl` commands will level up your day-to-day efficiency in any Kubernetes environmentâ€”especially when using infrastructure as code with Terraform or Helm. Keep this cheat sheet close, and you'll debug faster and deploy smarter.
