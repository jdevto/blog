Terraform state management is crucial for maintaining reliable and scalable infrastructure. When working across multiple environments like `dev`, `staging`, and `prod`, isolating state files is key to avoiding conflicts.

### Key Practices for Managing Terraform State

- **Use Remote Backends:** Store state in a shared backend like AWS S3 or Azure Blob Storage for secure access.
- **Environment-Specific State Files:** Create separate state files for each environment (e.g., `dev.tfstate`, `prod.tfstate`) to ensure isolated changes.
- **Lock State Files:** Enable locking with DynamoDB or similar services to prevent simultaneous updates.

Proper state management keeps your infrastructure predictable and reduces deployment risks!
