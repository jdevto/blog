If you've ever wondered how to get started with **AWS Control Tower**, this guide will walk you through creating your very first **landing zone** — the foundation for a well-governed, multi-account AWS environment.

## What is a Landing Zone?

A landing zone is AWS's recommended starting point for a secure, multi-account environment. When you set one up, Control Tower will automatically:

- Create **Organizational Units (OUs)** for governance
- Provision **Log Archive** and **Audit** accounts
- Enable **CloudTrail**, **AWS Config**, and baseline guardrails
- Give you a dashboard to monitor compliance across accounts

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:

- **Management account access** – Use an IAM user/role with `AdministratorAccess`, not the root user
- **Fresh AWS Organization** – Control Tower needs to be the one creating the OUs and shared accounts
- **Supported Region** – Make sure you're logged into a [Control Tower-supported region](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regional-product-services/)
  > 📝 **Tip:** The region you choose becomes the **home region** and cannot be changed later without deleting and recreating the landing zone
- **Time allocation** – Allow 30–60 minutes for landing zone setup (it's a long-running process)

## Step 1: Navigate to Control Tower

1. In the AWS Management Console, search for **Control Tower** and open it
2. Ensure you're in your desired **home region** (e.g., `ap-southeast-2`)
3. You should see the **Set up landing zone** button

Click **Set up landing zone** to begin.

## Step 2: Select Regions and Pricing

You'll first see a screen to review pricing and select regions for governance. Here you will:

- **Confirm Home Region** – This is where Control Tower and shared accounts will be provisioned
- **Select Governed Regions** – Choose any additional regions where you want AWS Config, CloudTrail, and guardrails automatically enabled
- **Region Deny Setting** – (Optional) Enable to block workloads from being launched in non-governed regions
  > ⚠️ **Warning:** Once enabled, this prevents using resources in any region not on your approved list. Make sure you don't have workloads in those regions before turning this on

Click **Next** when ready.

## Step 3: Configure Organizational Units (OUs)

In this step, Control Tower creates your **OU structure**:

- **Security OU** – Holds the Log Archive and Audit accounts
- **Sandbox OU** – For experimentation, POCs, or non-production accounts

You can rename these OUs now or later.
> 💡 **Tip:** Keep the default names (`Security` and `Sandbox`) unless you have strict naming rules in your organization.

## Step 4: Configure Shared Accounts

Control Tower will create two shared accounts automatically:

- **Log Archive Account** – Centralizes CloudTrail and Config logs
- **Audit Account** – Used for security and compliance auditing

You only need to provide unique account email addresses during this step.

> ⚠️ **Important:** These accounts are **permanent for the life of this landing zone**.
>
> - You cannot change their email addresses later
> - You cannot swap in a different account later
> - The only way to replace them is to **decommission the entire landing zone** and start over
>
> **💡 Pro Tip:** You don't need separate email accounts! Many email providers support aliases (like Gmail's +aliases) to create unique addresses that all deliver to your main inbox. For example:
>
> - `yourname+logarchive@gmail.com` for the Log Archive account
> - `yourname+audit@gmail.com` for the Audit account
>
> Learn more about [Gmail aliases and how to use them](https://dev.to/jajera/how-to-use-gmail-aliases-to-create-extra-email-addresses-1g14) for better email organization.

## Step 5: Additional Configurations

This step lets you configure account access, logging, and optional services:

- **AWS Account Access Configuration** – Select **AWS Control Tower sets up AWS account access with IAM Identity Center** unless you already manage access yourself
- **AWS CloudTrail Configuration** – Leave **Enabled** selected. This creates an organization-wide CloudTrail and sends logs to the Log Archive account
- **Log Configuration for Amazon S3** – Optionally adjust retention (default: 1 year for logging bucket, 10 years for access logging)
- **KMS Encryption** – (Optional) Enable if you want to use a customer-managed KMS key for encrypting logs
- **AWS Backup** – (Optional) Enable during setup, or leave disabled and configure later once backup policies are ready

Click **Next** when finished.

## Step 6: Review and Launch

Finally, review all of your settings:

- Home and governed regions
- OU structure
- Email addresses for shared accounts
- CloudTrail and log retention settings
- Optional encryption and backup settings

When everything looks good, click **Set up landing zone**.

## Step 7: Wait and Verify

Landing zone creation can take 30–60 minutes. Once it's done, you'll see the Control Tower **Dashboard**, showing your OUs, accounts, and compliance status.

## What's Next?

Once your landing zone is set up, consider these next steps:

- **Create additional OUs** for workloads (e.g., `Workloads`, `SharedServices`)
- **Enroll existing accounts** or create new ones in your landing zone
- **Enable additional guardrails** to enforce security and compliance requirements
- **Set up cross-account roles** for easier account management

## Why This Matters

Creating a landing zone is the first step toward a governed, scalable AWS environment. It gives you a foundation for security, compliance, and multi-account operations — all automated by AWS.
