### Optimizing AWS EventBridge: Default vs. Custom Event Buses and Best Practices

#### Introduction

Amazon EventBridge is a powerful service for routing AWS events to different targets. But many users wonder: **Should I use the default event bus or a custom one? Does having many rules cause issues?** In this guide, we'll answer these questions and provide **best practices** for managing EventBridge efficiently.

---

#### **1. Default vs. Custom Event Bus: Which One Should You Use?**

##### **✅ Default Event Bus (Best for AWS Services)**

AWS **automatically creates** the default event bus in every region. **Use it when you need to capture AWS service events, like EC2 state changes, S3 object creation, or Lambda executions.**

##### **🔹 Advantages of Default Event Bus:**

✔ **No setup required** – AWS services send events to it automatically.
✔ **Low latency** – Designed for quick event processing.
✔ **Less management overhead** – No need to create custom buses.
✔ **You are only billed when an event matches the rule.**

##### **📌 Terraform Example Using Default Event Bus**

```terraform
resource "aws_cloudwatch_event_rule" "this" {
  name        = "ec2-instance-state-change"
  description = "Capture EC2 instance state changes"
  event_pattern = jsonencode({
    source        = ["aws.ec2"]
    "detail-type" = ["EC2 Instance State-change Notification"]
    detail = {
      state         = ["pending", "running", "shutting-down", "stopping", "stopped", "terminated"]
      "instance-id" = ["i-0123456789abcdef0"]
    }
  })
}
```

**📌 Default bus is used automatically—no extra configuration needed!**

---

##### **✅ Custom Event Bus (For Custom or Cross-Account Events)**

Use a **custom event bus** when:

- You **send custom events** from applications.
- You **forward events across AWS accounts**.
- You **want to isolate different applications**.

##### **📌 Terraform Example Using a Custom Event Bus**

```terraform
resource "aws_cloudwatch_event_bus" "custom_bus" {
  name = "my-custom-event-bus"
}

resource "aws_cloudwatch_event_rule" "this" {
  name          = "custom-app-event"
  description   = "Capture custom application events"
  event_bus_name = aws_cloudwatch_event_bus.custom_bus.name
  event_pattern = jsonencode({
    source        = ["custom.application"]
    "detail-type" = ["Custom Event"]
  })
}
```

**📌 You must specify `event_bus_name` when using a custom bus.**

---

#### **2. Does Having Many Rules on the Default Event Bus Cause Issues?**

##### **🔹 Performance Considerations**

✅ **AWS EventBridge scales automatically** – having many rules does **not** slow down event processing.
✅ **Each rule processes events independently** – so multiple rules won’t interfere with each other.

##### **🔹 Cost Considerations**

✔ **Event rules do not incur a charge unless they match an event.**
✔ **If an event matches multiple rules, each rule is processed separately.**

##### **✅ Best Practices for Managing Many Rules**

###### **1️⃣ Use Specific Event Patterns**

**Bad (Too Broad, Matches Everything):**

```json
{
  "source": ["aws.ec2"]
}
```

**Good (More Specific):**

```json
{
  "source": ["aws.ec2"],
  "detail-type": ["EC2 Instance State-change Notification"],
  "detail": { "state": ["running"] }
}
```

###### **2️⃣ Deduplicate Similar Rules**

❌ **Inefficient (Separate Rules for Each State)**:

```terraform
resource "aws_cloudwatch_event_rule" "ec2_running" {
  name = "ec2-instance-running"
  event_pattern = jsonencode({ "detail": { "state": ["running"] } })
}
resource "aws_cloudwatch_event_rule" "ec2_stopped" {
  name = "ec2-instance-stopped"
  event_pattern = jsonencode({ "detail": { "state": ["stopped"] } })
}
```

✅ **Efficient (Single Rule with Multiple States):**

```terraform
resource "aws_cloudwatch_event_rule" "ec2_state_change" {
  name = "ec2-instance-state-change"
  event_pattern = jsonencode({ "detail": { "state": ["running", "stopped", "terminated"] } })
}
```

✔ **Fewer rules = Better management**

#### **3. How to Query EventBridge Events?**

##### **🔹 Query Events from the Last Hour**

```sh
aws cloudtrail lookup-events \
  --lookup-attributes AttributeKey=EventSource,AttributeValue=ec2.amazonaws.com \
  --start-time "$(date -u -d '1 hour ago' +'%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ')" \
  --max-results 50
```

##### **🔹 Simulate an Event to Test Matching**

```sh
aws events put-events --entries '[
  {
    "Source": "aws.ec2",
    "DetailType": "EC2 Instance State-change Notification",
    "Detail": "{\"state\": \"running\", \"instance-id\": \"i-0123456789abcdef0\"}"
  }
]'
```

#### **🚀 Final Thoughts: What Should You Use?**

| **Use Case** | **Event Bus Type** |
|-------------|-----------------|
| AWS Service Events (EC2, S3, CloudTrail) | ✅ Default Event Bus |
| Application-Specific Events | ✅ Custom Event Bus |
| Cross-Account Event Forwarding | ✅ Custom Event Bus |
| Simplicity & Auto-Scaling | ✅ Default Event Bus |

📌 **For most AWS services (like EC2 instance state changes), the default event bus is the best option!** 🚀
