I recently built a New Zealand–themed memory matching game using the [Amazon Q Developer CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/q/developer/) — a new tool that helps developers generate code using natural language, right in the terminal.

This was part of my submission for the [Build Games with Amazon Q CLI Challenge](https://community.aws/content/2xIoduO0xhkhUApQpVUIqBFGmAc/build-games-with-amazon-q-cli-and-score-a-t-shirt?trk=b085178b-f0cb-447b-b32d-bd0641720467&sc_channel=el) — and yes, there’s a t-shirt involved. 😄

## 🌿 Why a Kiwi-Themed Game?

As someone currently living in Aotearoa New Zealand, I wanted to create something that reflects the local culture and wildlife. The idea of using familiar NZ symbols — like the 🥝 kiwi bird, 🌿 silver fern, 🌀 koru, and 🐤 pūkeko — made the game not only fun but also meaningful to build.

It was also a perfect fit for a small offline browser game: simple logic, a welcoming tone, and room to apply accessibility and language features.

## 🧠 What I Built

🧠 [**Kiwi Memory Game**](https://jajera.github.io/q-kiwi-memory-game/) — a lightweight memory game playable in any browser.

- Built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**
- Features:
  - Card flip animations and match logic
  - Web Audio API–powered sound feedback
  - Theme and language toggle (English + Te Reo Māori)
  - Accessible with keyboard and screen readers
  - Works completely offline
  - Deployed via GitHub Pages

## ⚙️ How I Used Q CLI

Amazon Q CLI lets you generate, test, and refine code interactively in your terminal. Here's what my workflow looked like:

1. Logged in via `q login` using my Builder ID
2. Ran `q chat` to open an interactive code session
3. Pasted a detailed spec for the game — including visual style, logic, accessibility, and sound
4. Iterated multiple times to improve the UI, fix bugs, and add polish

📄 **[Full specification](https://github.com/jajera/q-kiwi-memory-game/blob/main/docs/kiwi-game-spec.md)** — The more specific your prompt, the better the results.

## 🧪 Lessons Learned

- Q CLI is a powerful tool for generating and scaffolding ideas quickly
- Clear, structured prompts yield far better results than vague ones
- It’s a collaborative tool — you still need to test, fix, and iterate
- Small games like this are a great sandbox for accessibility and browser-based UX
