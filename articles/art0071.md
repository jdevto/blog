## ✨ What is a GitHub Profile README?

A **profile README** is a special `README.md` file that appears at the top of your GitHub profile. It allows you to personalize your public GitHub page with:

- 🧾 Project highlights
- 🛠️ Toolchains and workflows
- 🧪 Stats, badges, and status
- 🖼️ Visual flair or branding

---

## 🚀 Why Create One?

✅ **Showcase Your Expertise** → Highlight your preferred stacks, tools, and contributions
✅ **First Impressions Matter** → Create a polished, branded look
✅ **Promote Repos** → Mention flagship projects with context
✅ **Document Dev Environment** → Surface automation and setup details

---

## 👨‍💻 Setting Up Your Profile README

### 1️⃣ Create a Special Repository

- Go to [github.com/new](https://github.com/new)
- Name the repo **exactly** the same as your GitHub username (e.g., `jajera`)
- Select **"Add a README"**
- Keep it **public**

> GitHub will auto-detect this and display the README on your profile page.

---

### 2️⃣ Structure Your Content

Here’s how `jajera` organizes the profile README:

```markdown
