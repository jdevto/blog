## 🚀 Securely Connecting to EC2 Instances with EC2 Instance Connect

Amazon EC2 Instance Connect provides a secure and convenient way to access EC2 instances **without requiring SSH key pairs or bastion hosts**. This feature simplifies SSH access management by allowing users to securely connect via the **AWS Console or CLI**.

## 🔗 Key Benefits of EC2 Instance Connect

- **No SSH Key Management** - Eliminates the need for manually managing SSH key pairs.
- **Enhanced Security** - Restricts direct access, leveraging AWS IAM permissions.
- **On-Demand Temporary Access** - Grants temporary SSH access to instances via an IAM policy.
- **Seamless AWS Console Integration** - Connect directly from the AWS Console with one click.

## 📝 Prerequisites

Before using EC2 Instance Connect, ensure you have:

- **An EC2 instance running a supported OS** (Amazon Linux 2, Ubuntu 20.04/22.04, Amazon Linux 2023 with manual setup).
- **AWS CLI installed** ([Setup Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-cliv2.html)).
- **IAM permissions to use EC2 Instance Connect** (`ec2-instance-connect:SendSSHPublicKey`).
- **Security group rules allowing EC2 Instance Connect traffic** (AWS-managed prefix lists are recommended).

## 📝 Supported Operating Systems

EC2 Instance Connect is **natively supported** on the following Amazon-provided AMIs:

- **Amazon Linux 2**
- **Ubuntu 20.04 and 22.04**
- **Amazon Linux 2023 requires manual installation of EC2 Instance Connect and has been tested successfully.**

Other operating systems may work with additional configuration.

## 🌐 How EC2 Instance Connect Works

When a user initiates a connection via **AWS Console or CLI**, AWS generates a **temporary SSH key** and injects it into the instance. The key is used for authentication, and access is granted **only for the duration of the session**.

## 📚 Terraform Sample Repository

For a working Terraform example demonstrating EC2 Instance Connect, check out:

[**👉 GitHub Repository: EC2 Instance Connect Terraform Demo**](https://github.com/jdevto/tf-aws-ec2-instance-connect-demo)

## 🔍 Troubleshooting EC2 Instance Connect Issues

### **❌ EC2 Instance Connect Option is Disabled in AWS Console**

✅ Ensure the **instance is in a public subnet** and has a **public IP**.
✅ Verify that **Amazon Linux 2 or Ubuntu** is used (other OS may require manual setup).

### **❌ "Instance is Not Reachable" Error**

✅ Confirm that **EC2 Instance Connect Agent is installed and running** (`systemctl status ec2-instance-connect` on Amazon Linux 2023).
✅ The instance must have **outbound internet connectivity** (NAT Gateway or AWS PrivateLink required for package updates).

## 📈 Summary

EC2 Instance Connect simplifies access to EC2 instances by providing **temporary, keyless SSH access**.
