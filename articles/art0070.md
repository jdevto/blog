## 🚁 Lambda@Edge: Run Code at the Edge with CloudFront

**Lambda@Edge** brings the power of serverless computing closer to your users by running AWS Lambda functions at **CloudFront edge locations** around the world. That means lower latency, personalized responses, and enhanced security — all without managing infrastructure.

---

## 🚀 What is Lambda@Edge?

Lambda@Edge extends AWS Lambda to CloudFront, allowing you to execute code *at the edge*, near the user. Instead of sending every request to a central region or origin server, you can run logic immediately at the request/response boundary.

### 🔧 Common Use Cases

- ✅ Redirects and URL rewrites
- ✅ Authentication and authorization at the edge
- ✅ Injecting security headers
- ✅ Geo-targeted content
- ✅ A/B testing

---

## 🛁 How It Works

Lambda@Edge functions are associated with specific CloudFront events:

| Event Type        | When It Happens                           |
|-------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| `viewer-request`  | Before CloudFront checks its cache        |
| `origin-request`  | Before forwarding the request to origin   |
| `origin-response` | After the origin returns the response     |
| `viewer-response` | Before returning response to the viewer   |

---

## 🔒 Example: Add Security Headers

```js
exports.handler = async (event) => {
  const response = event.Records[0].cf.response;
  response.headers['strict-transport-security'] = [{
    key: 'Strict-Transport-Security',
    value: 'max-age=63072000; includeSubdomains; preload'
  }];
  response.headers['x-content-type-options'] = [{
    key: 'X-Content-Type-Options',
    value: 'nosniff'
  }];
  return response;
};
```

Attach this function to the `viewer-response` event.

## 🌍 Deploying with Terraform

```terraform
provider "aws" {
  region = "us-east-1" # Required for Lambda@Edge
}

resource "aws_iam_role" "lambda_edge" {
  name = "lambda-edge-role"
  assume_role_policy = jsonencode({
    Version = "2012-10-17",
    Statement = [
      {
        Action = "sts:AssumeRole",
        Effect = "Allow",
        Principal = {
          Service = [
            "lambda.amazonaws.com",
            "edgelambda.amazonaws.com"
          ]
        }
      }
    ]
  })
}

resource "aws_lambda_function" "edge_function" {
  filename         = "lambda.zip"
  function_name    = "edge-header-fn"
  handler          = "index.handler"
  runtime          = "nodejs18.x"
  role             = aws_iam_role.lambda_edge.arn
  publish          = true # Required
}

resource "aws_cloudfront_distribution" "cdn" {
  # Your origin and behavior config...

  default_cache_behavior {
    target_origin_id = "origin1"

    lambda_function_association {
      event_type   = "viewer-response"
      lambda_arn   = aws_lambda_function.edge_function.qualified_arn
      include_body = false
    }
  }
}
```

> 💡 You **must** deploy Lambda@Edge functions in **us-east-1** and use a **published version**, not `$LATEST`.

---

## ⚠️ High-Level Limitations

- 🔹 Must be deployed in `us-east-1`
- 🔹 Requires published version (not `$LATEST`)
- 🔹 Limited runtime support (Node.js and Python only)
- 🔹 No support for VPC, env vars, layers, container images, or custom runtimes
- 🔹 Propagation delays after update due to edge replication

## 🧠 Runtime Support

Lambda@Edge currently supports only the following runtimes:

| Runtime       | Supported? |
|---------------|------------|
| `nodejs18.x`  | ✅         |
| `nodejs16.x`  | ✅         |
| `python3.9`   | ✅         |
| `python3.8`   | ✅         |
| Go, Java, .NET, Ruby, etc. | ❌ Not supported |
| Custom runtimes, container images | ❌ Not supported |

> 📌 No Go, Java, or custom runtimes. AWS has not announced plans for additional runtime support.

Alternatives:

- 🧠 CloudFront Functions (JavaScript-only)
- 🧠 Fastly Compute@Edge or Cloudflare Workers
- 🧠 Regular Lambda + API Gateway (if latency is acceptable)

---

## ✅ When Should You Use Lambda@Edge?

Use it when you need:

- Low-latency, globally distributed logic
- Lightweight request/response transformations
- Offloading processing from origin servers
- Better control over caching behavior
