## Introduction

When launching AWS EC2 instances, having a **Message of the Day (MOTD)** can provide useful system information at login. This is particularly useful for cloud-based environments, where instances are frequently provisioned and accessed by multiple users.

In this guide, we will cover how to customize the MOTD for **Amazon Linux 2**, **Amazon Linux 2023**, and **Ubuntu 22.04** using **Terraform** with **cloud-init** and **EC2 Instance Connect** (no SSH keys required).

### **Repository**

This project is available on GitHub: [tf-aws-ec2-motd-demo](https://github.com/jdevto/tf-aws-ec2-motd-demo). The repository contains the full Terraform configuration and cloud-init script for deploying EC2 instances with a customized MOTD.

## Why Customize the MOTD?

A well-configured MOTD can:

- Display **system information** (e.g., instance ID, IP address, CPU load)
- Provide **reminders or warnings** for users
- Offer a **quick overview** of the instance status
- Improve **administrative efficiency** for cloud environments

## Where MOTD Files Are Stored and Execution Order

Each operating system handles MOTD differently. The files are stored in different locations and executed in a specific order:

- **Amazon Linux 2 & Amazon Linux 2023:**

  - The MOTD scripts are stored in `/etc/update-motd.d/`.
  - Files in this directory are executed in numerical order.
  - Default files include:
    - `30-banner` (displays the Amazon Linux banner)
    - `50-amazon-linux-extras-news` (news updates from Amazon Linux Extras)
    - `70-available-updates` (package update notifications)
    - `99-system-info` (custom MOTD script, added via cloud-init)
  - The final MOTD is displayed by concatenating the outputs of these scripts in order.

- **Ubuntu 22.04:**

  - Uses `/etc/update-motd.d/` as well but has additional MOTD management with `update-motd`.
  - The execution order follows the script numbering:
    - `00-header` (displays system details)
    - `10-help-text` (Ubuntu-specific help text)
    - `50-motd-news` (news updates from Canonical)
    - `99-system-info` (custom MOTD script, added via cloud-init)
  - Ubuntu dynamically generates `/etc/motd` by running all executable scripts in `/etc/update-motd.d/` in numerical order and writing their output to `/run/motd.dynamic`.
  - The contents of `/run/motd.dynamic` are displayed upon user login.

### **Naming Convention and Execution Order**

The naming convention of MOTD scripts follows a **numeric order**, ensuring that scripts execute sequentially:

- Lower-numbered scripts **run first**.
- Higher-numbered scripts **run later**.
- If multiple scripts have the same numeric prefix, they execute **alphabetically**.

For example:

- **Amazon Linux default scripts**:

  - `30-banner`
  - `50-amazon-linux-extras-news`
  - `70-available-updates`
  - `99-system-info` (custom script added via cloud-init)

- **Ubuntu default scripts**:

  - `00-header`
  - `10-help-text`
  - `50-motd-news`
  - `99-system-info` (custom script added via cloud-init)

If needed, you **can use numbers beyond 99**, such as `100-custom-script`, to ensure that your script executes **after all other system scripts**.

By naming our custom MOTD script `99-system-info`, we ensure that it executes **after all default system scripts**. This prevents other scripts from overriding or modifying the MOTD output.

## Implementing MOTD with Terraform and Cloud-Init

AWS EC2 allows you to pass **user_data** scripts that run at instance launch. We will use **Terraform** to deploy EC2 instances with a **cloud-init YAML file** that configures a dynamic MOTD and enables **EC2 Instance Connect**.

### **1️⃣ Define Cloud-Init Configuration**

Save the following cloud-init YAML as `external/cloud-init.yaml` in your Terraform module directory:

```yaml
#cloud-config
package_update: true
package_upgrade: true
package_reboot_if_required: true

write_files:
  - path: /etc/update-motd.d/99-system-info
    content: |
      #!/bin/bash

      OS_VERSION=$(grep -E '^PRETTY_NAME=' /etc/os-release | cut -d= -f2 | tr -d '"')
      INSTANCE_ID=$(curl -s http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/instance-id)
      AZ=$(curl -s http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/placement/availability-zone)
      PUBLIC_IP=$(curl -s --fail http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/public-ipv4 2>/dev/null || echo "None")
      PRIVATE_IP=$(curl -s http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/local-ipv4)
      CPU_LOAD=$(uptime | awk -F'load average:' '{ print $2 }')
      MEMORY_USAGE=$(free -h | awk '/Mem:/ {print $3 "/" $2}')
      DISK_USAGE=$(df -h --output=used,size / | tail -n 1 | awk '{print $1 "/" $2}')
      NETWORK_INTERFACES=$(ip -br link show | awk '{print $1}' | grep -v lo)

      echo "Welcome to your instance"
      echo ""
      echo "OS Version: $OS_VERSION"
      echo "Instance ID: $INSTANCE_ID"
      echo "Availability Zone: $AZ"
      echo "Public IP: $PUBLIC_IP"
      echo "Private IP: $PRIVATE_IP"
      echo ""
      echo "System Information:"
      echo "  - CPU Load: $CPU_LOAD"
      echo "  - Memory Usage: $MEMORY_USAGE"
      echo "  - Disk Usage: $DISK_USAGE"
      echo "  - Network Interfaces: $NETWORK_INTERFACES"
      echo ""
    permissions: '0755'
```

## **Conclusion**

By using **Terraform, cloud-init, and EC2 Instance Connect**, administrators can configure **dynamic MOTD messages** on **Amazon Linux 2, Amazon Linux 2023, and Ubuntu 22.04** without SSH keys. This method ensures that system information is readily available at login via the AWS Console.
